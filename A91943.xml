            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Your friendly favours I may not bury, in a kind of tacite acknowledgment; but I muſt needs acquaint the World with a part of them.

            <p>The ſame cauſe (than) I have, of reſpective thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the one, as well as to the other; and no other
<pb facs="tcp:115539:4"/>way have I really to expreſs this thankefulneſs (be ſide my Prayers) than by ſending forth theſe Papers, under your Names, the poor Preſent of an ever remaining Debtor, wiſhing they were as worthy of reſpect from you, as in many reſpects they do belong unto you.</p>
            <p>I ſend them not cloathed, (as the Mother of <hi>Cyrus</hi> willed, that the words of thoſe who ſpake unto her Son ſhould be) in Silk; but in a homely Countrey dreſs, ſuch as they were clad withall, in the firſt delivery; <hi>I may truly ſay with</hi> Moſes, I am not elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,<note place="margin">Exod. 1.10.</note> neither at any time have been. <hi>And yet I ſhould be loath to deliver my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Meſſage, with irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and uncircumciſed lips;</hi> but in ſuch a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as may beſeem his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice regarding more that my words be full of ſenſe, then of ſound,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4.</note> and ſuch was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſpeech; might my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be like his, then I ſhould think I were rightly elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:115539:4"/>Language being ſpoken, (and that generally the Hearer is much affected with); but that luſtre is lost in writing which our words had in the delivery.

However, this my labour, in reſpect of the ſtyle and phraſe, may be judged by a curious Eye to be ſimple, plain, and popular, and in that reſpect contemptible; yet I aſſure you, that the Subject-matter of the Book is Divine and ſacred, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect not deſpicable; but ſuch as may exerciſe the Devotion of the beſt Lady in the Land.

For, albeit words ſpoken, move very much for the preſent, in the lively delivery of them;<note place="margin">Vox audita perit, litera ſcripta ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</note> yet ordinarily they fly, and dye: No ſooner are they ſpoken, but they vaniſh like a ſound in the Air, and are forgotten; when as this loſs of the Ear is reſtored by the Eye, in the reading of things

            <p>THe occaſion of propounding this parable,<note place="margin">The Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> is intimated in the beginning of this Chapter, ſo it was that <hi>as Christ was praying in a certain place, when he ceaſed one of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples ſaid unto him, Lord teach us to pray, as</hi> John <hi>alſo taught his Diſciples.</hi> They who followed Chriſt, could not but take notice, how abundant he was in that duty; and thereupon conceived, that Prayer was a buſineſſe of great importance, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Chriſt would not have been ſo often at it: whereupon no ſooner had he made an end, (for they would not interrupt him, whilſt he was at his devotions) but one of them in the name of the reſt, as being all privie to their own infirmities, not knowing what to ask, nor how to ask, as they ſhould; deſires Chriſt to teach them how to pray: that is, to give them a form of prayer, to the end, that they might not fail either in the matter or manner of prayer: which requeſt they urge from <hi>Johns</hi> example, who (as it ſeems) had given his diſciples a plat-form of prayer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 1.37.</note> [and this they ſpake from their own experience, for ſome of them had been before times Diſciples unto <hi>Iohn.</hi>]</p>
            <p>This requeſt of theirs, Chriſt is pleaſed preſently to grant,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 2, 3, 4.</note> and preſcribes a form, <hi>verſe</hi> 2, 3, 4. This he willeth them to uſe, and that not onely as a perfect and genuine Rule of prayer, whereby
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115539:16"/>they were to frame all prayers that they made to God, (which is the opinion of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and other Sectaries grounded on <hi>Math.</hi> 6.9.) but as a prayer, even word for word; uſe it, when you pray, <hi>ſay;</hi> ſay what? even theſe words which now I put into your Mouthes. <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>beit we may not think that it was the intent of Chriſt, to binde us ſtrictly to that <hi>form of words,</hi> (ſo that we muſt alwayes uſe them and no other) but to the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> of this prayer, we are principally tied; and if we compare theſe two Evangeliſts together, it will appear that both this very form may be uſed, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formes alſo may be framed, anſwerable to this.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Scope.</note>The <hi>Plat-form</hi> being given, our Saviour proceeds to preſſe the Uſe; Aſſuring them of good ſucceſſe, if they do not faint nor flagg in the performance of that dutie: and to that purpoſe propounds two Parables; the one now read, wherein God is preſented to us, as a <hi>friend,</hi> who is ready at all times to ſupply the wants of his friends for friendſhip ſake, the other of a <hi>Father</hi> who will not be wanting to his Child, in ſupplying of his need as occaſion ſerves, <hi>verſe</hi> 11.12, 13. In both he argues from the leſſe unto the greater, If a friend will do thus and thus for his friend; and an Earthly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo and ſo for his Child; then doubt not but God who is both you friend and father, (and you dearer to him then any friend can be unto his friend, or Son to an Earthly Parent) will give you audience (come when you will) and ſupply your wants, (be they what they will be): for God loves not his friends and his Children leſſe then men do theirs, but far more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Parable</hi> of a <hi>friend coming to his friend at Mid-night,</hi>

            <p>Firſt the <hi>thing wanted [Bread]</hi> which is one of the greateſt wants that can befall a man.</p>
            <p>Secondly the <hi>Courſe</hi> he was enforced to take for the ſupplying of that his want, <hi>He goes unto his friend at Mid-night, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where take notice firſt of the <hi>Addreſſe</hi> he made <hi>verſe</hi> 5, 6. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly of the <hi>Repulſe</hi> that he received, <hi>verſe</hi> 7.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>in that he did, [he goeth to him at Mid-night];</hi> where, his <hi>Action,</hi> he goes, he ſitts not ſtill, under a ſenſe of that his want, he ſends not a ſervant to ſeek out for ſupply, but gets out adoores himſelf, and goes unto his friend. And the <hi>Amplification,</hi> from the Circumſtance of <hi>Time,</hi> it was at <hi>Mid-night,</hi> when one would think fitter for him to be in bed, then out of doores.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>By that he ſaid, [Friend lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine, &amp;c.]</hi> And there we have his ſuit firſt <hi>Propounded,</hi> and then <hi>Proſecuted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is <hi>Propoſed</hi> and made known in thoſe words, <hi>[Friend lend me three loaves]</hi> and there the <hi>manner</hi> and the <hi>matter</hi> is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

            <p>For the <hi>Manner</hi> he propoſeth it <hi>Rhetorically,</hi> by way of inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, prefacing it with a loving Compellation, <hi>[friend]</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I hold you for my friend, and that Emboldens me at this time to trouble you.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Matter [lend me three Loaves]:</hi> And there we have the <hi>thing deſired,</hi> which was to <hi>Lend, [Lend me]</hi> he deſireth not any thing of gift, he would onely borrow, and ſo repay again; and then the <hi>facility</hi> of it (covertly uſed as a motive); he deſired not to borrow of him gold or ſilver, but three loaves of bread; <hi>Bread</hi> for <hi>Quality,</hi> and <hi>three Loaves</hi> for <hi>Quantity. Lend me three Loaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Requeſt is <hi>Proſecuted</hi> and Preſſed, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>[For a friend of mine in his journey is come unto me, &amp;c.]</hi> And here the <hi>Impulſive</hi> cauſe is unfolded of his coming to borrow at ſuch a time of night, Neceſſity compelled him to do it, and that partly in reſpect of his <hi>gueſt,</hi> and partly of <hi>himſelf.</hi>

            <p>In <hi>reſpect of his gueſt, [A friend of mine in his journey is come unto me]:</hi> Where obſerve; firſt the <hi>Relation</hi> that his gueſt had unto him, he was a <hi>friend</hi> of his; ſecondly, the <hi>Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In reſpect of <hi>Himſelf, [I have nothing to ſet before him]</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I ought to ſhew my ſelf friendly to my friend, and give him courteous entertainment, who comes thus in a friendly way to viſit me: but alas ſuch is my condition, that I have not ſo much as bread to ſet before him; had I of mine own, I would not at this time be troubleſome unto thee, but want is the cauſe (at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) of my putting you to this trouble.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Repulſe</hi> that he received in his ſuit, followeth <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>[And he from within ſhall anſwer, and ſay, Trouble me not, &amp;c.]</hi> Where obſerve, firſt by <hi>whom</hi> his ſuite is anſwered, <hi>[He from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhall anſwer]</hi> that is, the friend he had addreſſed himſelf unto: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the <hi>Anſwer</hi> it ſelf that was given, containing in it an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi> and <hi>Reſolution.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Aſſertion</hi> is three fold, (according to the three fold urging of the Duty) and enfolded with the Precept <hi>Ask</hi> and <hi>[it ſhall be given unto you]</hi> Seek and <hi>[you ſhall finde] Knock</hi> and <hi>[it ſhall be opened unto you].</hi> It is <hi>Amplified,</hi> and enlarged, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. <hi>[For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that asketh, receiveth].</hi> And wherein we may take notice, firſt, of the Extent of the Grant, it reacheth to every one that asketh,

            <p>And thus you ſee, this Parable is like a goodly ſpreading tree; from the Body whereof proceedeth ſundry Armes; from them, ſundry Branches; each Branch hath its leſſer twiggs; and not a Twigg, without ſome fruit growing on it, notwithſtanding we may not overreach our ſelves in the gathering; as for the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boughs,</hi> a little ſhake ſhall ſerve; I may touch upon them, but not ſtand on them: The Muſitian, in playing ſome Leſſons upon his Inſtrument, tunes every ſtring, albeit ſome of them be ſcarſe once ſtruck, or toucht in playing of the Leſſon; ſo in the opening of this Parable, divers things for Method's ſake are brought into our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, which needs not any large Proſecution: we look not on every particular colour in a well drawn Picture, but on the whole peice; it is enough in opening of a Parable, to caſt our eye prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally upon the generall intention and ſcope, albeit we vievv not exactly every particular Circumſtance; As vve ſay of curious <hi>Watches,</hi> ſo may vve ſay of curious <hi>Obſervations</hi> from Parables; Not one of many, that goeth true.</p>

And you may, in the ſame Chapter, find a <hi>Sonne</hi> of the ſame Family (too:) going into the Fields to pray and meditate, <label type="milestone">

Thus <hi>Sonnes</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> in ſuch Families as are religious, will go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their buſineſs, praying, and meditating, and ſo have a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing attend them; (without which early riſing, and late going to bed, is to no purpoſe,) when Servants that are untaught,<note place="margin">Pſal. 127.2.</note> and live in irreligious Families, go about their buſineſs, mumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and mutteringly; rayling, and reviling, curſing, and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo have the curſe of God following them, in all that they put their hands unto.

That will cauſe them to do their work for <hi>Conſcience ſake,</hi> to be faithful, as well in their Governours abſence, as preſence; and ſtir them up to pray for

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is a <hi>great honour to a Family,</hi> to be godly, and Religious, ſuch Families are <hi>Churches,</hi> and are dignified with that Title (<hi>Rom.</hi> 16.2.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Philem.</hi> 2.)

               </hi> in that they are become the Children of God, and Heirs of Grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it brings much <hi>comfort to Governours,</hi> when thoſe under their charge become Religious,<note place="margin">3 Epiſt. Joh. 4. Prov. 10.1. &amp; 23, 24, 25. 1 Theſ. 2.20.</note> the comfort and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a mans life, lies much in his Family. <hi>Ye are our joy, and Crown of rejoycing,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> in another caſe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.20. ſo may Governours ſay of a Religious and well governed Family: But on the other ſide, looſneſs and diſorder in a Family, makes the lives of the Governours thereof to be very uncomfortable (ſo the rude, and untoward behaviour of the Wives of prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>great account</hi> that Governours are to make to God, for the neglect of their Duties herein, ſhould make them the more careful. Our Servants and our Children are not our own,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.20.</note> but Gods, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20. they are born to him, and muſt be educated and brought up for him. You are but Gods Deputies, and govern for him: All the power that thou canſt challenge in thy Family, is <hi>ſubordinate;</hi> we truſt our Servants with our goods, and God truſts us with their ſouls; and he hath given a ſtrait charge unto us, of every one that comes under our Roof, (not much unlike that in the Parable, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.39. <hi>Look to this man, if by any means he be miſſing thy life goes for his life:</hi> So) look to this thy Child,<note place="margin">1 King. 20.39.</note> thy Servant; if he be wanting, or miſſing, if his ſoul periſh through thy negligence, thy ſoul dies for his. Thus <hi>Ely</hi> was charged with the ſins of his Children,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.29.</note> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.29. (And, as you know, many a man is undone by Suretiſhip): But if

               <note place="margin">Iſa. 8.18. Joh. 17.12.</note> 
               <hi>and the Children that thou hast given me:</hi> or as Chriſt in that Prayer of his, <hi>I have loſt none of them that thou haſt given me, but that Sonne of perdition</hi> which was loſt before, this will further our Account to our endleſs comfort. And thus (in many reſpects) if we love our ſelves, we ſhould teach our Families to be Religious.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, the <hi>tender love and compaſſion,</hi> that we bear at leaſt pretend to bear to thoſe that are under our charge, ſhould put us upon the Duty.<note place="margin">Ecclus. 33.29.</note> 
               <hi>If thou have a faithful Servant</hi> (ſaid the Sonne of <hi>Syrach,</hi>) let <hi>him be unto thee as thy own ſoul.</hi> The ſoul is near and dear to us, (I am ſure it ought to be.) Now he that loves his ſoul, will have a care to teach and inſtruct that ſoul; ſo ſhould thoſe Governours have a care to inſtruct and teach their Families, that love their Families. Meat, Drink, Apparel, and other neceſſaries of Nature, are not more needful for their bodies preſervation, then holy Inſtruction is for their ſouls ſalvation. Thus you ſee, what Reaſon you have to do, as you from Chriſts example are here taught to do, <hi>viz.</hi> to take care, that thoſe under your charge, be taught Religion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the wayes to Heaven.</p>

            <p>You are to feed your Families, as the Paſtor of the Church is to feed his Flock.

            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine,</hi> is a principall note of a <hi>true Church:</hi>

            <p>Oh that you governours had this care to ſee Religion flouriſh in your houſes! the want whereof is a cauſe that Gods bleſſing is wanting on all other cares you take; and that your Children and Servants remaine, the Children and Servants of the Divell; you neglecting thoſe meanes, whereby they ſhould be made the Children and Servants of God: Is he <hi>worſe then an Infidell,</hi>

            <p>To Doctrine, <hi>Diſcipline</hi> muſt be joyned; this though it be not of the <hi>Being</hi> of a Church; yet it makes for the <hi>well being</hi> of it, without which a Church is defective, and will ſoon corrupt and come to nought, ſo it is in your Families: Diſcipline may be no more wanting in the houſe, then in the Church.

               <hi>Experience</hi> furniſheth us with a third: Friendſhip was ever rare to find, but more rare then ever, by how much the world is more corrupt then ever. <hi>Machiavells</hi> Tenents are more ſet by, (ſhall I ſay, then the Rules of <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato</hi> or any Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, nay) then the Tenants of Chriſt himſelf; His Schollars have ſo well profited in his School, that many of them are able to teach their Maſter; Profeſſe (ſaith he) Love and Friendſhip to thy Neighbour, who if he be up to the knees in water, then lend him thy hand to pull him out; Is he up to the Waſt? do thy beſt then; to help him: but if he be up to the chin, then thy hand upon his head, and duck him under, ſuffer him not to riſe any more: Such is the friendſhip of this age, wherein the habits of mens minds, are as much changed, as the habit of their bodies. That friendſhip, and honeſtie which in times paſt, had <hi>the hand on the Heart,</hi> now hath it <hi>on the Toe:</hi> Faithfull, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall dealing, is now grown cleane out of faſhion, and nothing left but <hi>Cringes</hi> and <hi>Complements.</hi> Thus you have the Grounds, and Reaſons, of the point.

               <hi>Keckerman</hi> relates a ſtorie of an old man,<note place="margin">Ethic. p. 369. <hi>E.</hi>
               </note> who upon his death bed, asked his Sonne, What Friends he had: he anſwered him, <hi>Very many:</hi> well, ſaid the Father, I have lived ſo long in the world, and yet have found but <hi>half a Friend:</hi> But this do, try thy Friends before thou need'ſt them; Goe kill a Calfe, put it into a ſack, and pretend that it is a Child which thou haſt untimely ſlaine, deſire their advice, and counſell, and that they would conceal the fact: he did ſo, and upon tryall, found, that all his Friends deſerted him; not one that ſtuck cloſe unto him: Then by his Fathers advice, he went unto his <hi>half-Friend,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115539:35"/>aſſented to the burying of it: in the meane time his other Friends, had accuſed him (for that ſuppoſed fact) and had brought him to Execution; had not the matter been diſcovered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guecarra</hi> obſerves as much: By my own Experience (ſaith he) if thou wilt beleeve me, I know not any thing wherein thou maiſt be ſooner deceived, then in this point of Friendſhip: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares (and more) with ſome judgment I remember the world, in which time, I have found, ſuch alteration in mens minds, and manners, that if they ſhould decline as faſt from evil to worſe, after fortie yeares more, it will be a hard matter to find a faithfull Friend, or an honeſt man.</p>
            <p>For the better clearing, and fuller evincing of the point deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto you, it will not be amiſſe to take notice, <hi>what friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is;</hi> with the ſeverall ſorts <hi>and kinds of it:</hi> which when we rightly underſtand, it will appeare that we are much miſtaken in the point of Friendſhip, and that amongſt thoſe many we take for Friends, there is ſcarce a true Friend to be found amongſt them all.</p>

               <note place="margin">Freindſhip, what it is.</note>Friendſhip is by ſome deſcribed to be <hi>the ſweetneſſe, intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſtrength of Love;</hi> Or (as others) more large<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>By which it appeares,<note place="margin">Hart's. Caha. <hi>21.</hi>
               </note> firſt, that <hi>Acquaintance</hi> is not <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi> That is but the firſt draught of it: that is (ſaith one) as the <hi>Herd;</hi> Friendſhip is the <hi>Paire,</hi> that is taken or choſen out of it: That (in ordinary uſe) is but a ſharing of talke, news, meat, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement: A thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Galat. 1.18, 19.</note> there is a difference betwixt <hi>Good-will</hi> and <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> Good wil we ſhould beare to thoſe we never ſaw, that know us not, (As St. <hi>Paul</hi> did to <hi>Peter, Jeams</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> before he ever ſaw their faces) But we have Friendſhip onely with ſuch men, as we have both ſeen, and known, and been converſant withall, and taken great liking of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; betwixt <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> there is a difference.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115539:35"/>A man may love thoſe, who love not him; but friendſhip is mutuall. <hi>Seneca</hi> compares it to a game at Tennis, wherein the ball is toſſed, and not ſuffered to fall; if it do, he forfeits who miſſeth the ſtroake? Or like two Lutes meeting in pitch and neerneſſe, the ſtriking of the one makes the other ſound. So is it with true Friends; And ſo it was between <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and between <hi>Baſill</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> of whom it was ſaid that <hi>anima una erat incluſa in duobus corporibus;</hi> they ſeemed to have one ſoul, in two bodyes: Yea many bodies and many ſouls, are by Friendſhip made but one; for if a hundred men love together as they ought, there is but one heart amongſt them, <hi>Act.</hi> 4, 32. Theſe things, duly conſidered,<note place="margin">Acts 4.32.</note> will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleare it, that many are miſtaken in point of Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let us diſtinguiſh (as Scripture doth) of Friendſhip. <hi>A Friend</hi> is taken ſometimes, <hi>largely</hi> for a common or <hi>ſeeming Friend</hi> (as <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.20.) <hi>The Rich hath many Friends:</hi> This is <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Friendſhip.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 14.20.</note> Sometimes it is taken <hi>strictly</hi> for a <hi>faithfull Friend</hi> indeed, (ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.24.) <hi>There is a Friend that stieketh cloſer then a Brother.</hi> Theſe Friends that are faſt and faithfull,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.24.</note> are joyned together in the Truth of Affection and Religion, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Greet them that love us in the Faith:</hi> And it ariſeth from effectuall good-will of one to another,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.15.</note> and is grounded on <hi>morall goodneſſe,</hi> this is <hi>perfect Friendſhip,</hi> and cannot be but amongſt the good. The other ſort of Friends, <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>fained,</hi> are ſuch as are not united to us by Religion, and true Affection, but for by, and ſiniſter ends;<note place="margin">Vulgus amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias utilitate prebat.

Such Friends <hi>David</hi> found in his proſperity; <hi>Shemei</hi> was no Railer, nor yet <hi>Achitophell</hi> a Traitor;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.31. 2 Sam. 16.5.13.

Theſe Friends are like <hi>Familiar Divells,</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Witches when they have brought them into fetters; or at beſt, but like <hi>Moſes-rod,</hi> they will ſeemingly be for a while, a ſtaffe to ſtay us; but anon of a rodd, they are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Serpent, mortally to ſting us.

Secondly, the meanes which you are to uſe, that you may obtain them. <hi>Antisthenes</hi> uſed to wonder at thoſe who were curious in buying but an Earthen diſh, and yet were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the choyce of Friends: wherefore</p>
            <p>In chuſing of a Friend, let me ſhew you, firſt, whom you are to avoid and take heed of. Secondly, whom you are to pitch your affections upon, and enter into a league of friendſhip with.</p>
            <p>There are ſundry ſorts of men, that it is not wiſdom to enter into ſerious friendſhip withall. The firſt is the <hi>Angry man,</hi> make <hi>no friendſhip with an angry man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 22.24.</note> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) and <hi>with the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man thou ſhalt not go,</hi> Prov. 22.24. But here we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Anger. There is <hi>Anger mortified</hi> and ſubdued in a man, and <hi>Anger raigning;</hi> with the former nothing hinders, but we may be familiar friends. Some Friends may by Nature, be ſomewhat haſty: Friendſhip with theſe may not be excluded, when through Gods grace, they bridle themſelves in ſome good meaſure. But with the latter, ſuch a one, as is <hi>a man of Anger,</hi> whoſe Anger is his Lord and Maſter, that cannot command his paſſion, but is in bondage to it, make no friendſhip with him: the Reaſon the wiſe man renders, verſ. 29. <hi>leſt thou learn his wayes, and get a ſnare to thy ſoul.</hi> The love of Friends will quickly breed, a love of their doings; and ſo inſtead of getting a Friend, thou wilt get a ſnare unto thy ſoul, and fall into ſome evil, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, into which Anger and Fury driveth men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Covetous man</hi> is not fit to be entred withall into a league of friendſhip; for that friendſhip is ill made, which is ſoon broken,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Actum eſt de amicitia.</hi> Prov. 1.19. 1 Tim. 6.10. 2 Sam. 16.3. 1 Sam. 25.10. 2 Tim. 4 10.

And <hi>ſuch are the wayes of every one that is greedy of gain, he will not ſtick to take away life from the owner,</hi> Prov. 1.19. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs is the <hi>Root of all evil,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.10. No ſin ſo barbarous as it, Experience verifieth this: It breaks all bands of amity, nature, duty, as might be exemplified in <hi>Ziba, Nabal, Demas Judas:</hi> Love of <hi>Lucre</hi> cauſeth a man to betray the beſt Friend
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115539:40"/>living. All the kindneſs of the covetous, is but like the Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſhrap, wherein he caſts meat, not our of kindneſs to relieve the Birds, but treachery, to enſnare them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Drunkard</hi> is as unfit a piece of Timber for this Building, as either of the former; for (beſides the learning of his vices,) there is no truſting him with our ſecrets: his mind and ſtomach are alike, neither can retain what they receive.

            <p>Fourthly, The <hi>crafty,</hi> worldly, and carnal <hi>Politician,</hi> is held to be one of the worſt ſort of men, to make a friend of. Subtile heads, have not the faithfuleſt hearts; uſually, where a politique head ſowes, a falſe heart waters; and there God gives no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.

Seek not a friend amongſt theſe; for they ſo often remove their Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that you will not know where to find them, when you ſtand in moſt need.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Nor is one of <hi>noted duplicity,</hi> or double dealing, fit for friendſhip; ſuch <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.2. he that is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taxed with this aſperſion, that he is <hi>double-tongued,</hi>

And yet herein many circumſtances are to be weighed, and well conſidered, before we refuſe to receive one into our former friendſhip and favour, who hath ſhewed himſelf an enemy unto us, and dealt falſly with us: As firſt, whether the wrong he did us, was out of <hi>weakneſs and frailty,</hi> or out of <hi>envy and ſpight.</hi> Secondly, whether he hath ſhewed any tokens or evidences of <hi>unfeigned ſorrow,</hi> for the wrong done.

            <p>A good and gracious man,<note place="margin">Vera amicitia tantum inter bonos oritur, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bones profuit, inter optimos con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummatur. Caſſiodor. <hi>5. Pſal.</hi>
               </note> is fit only to make a faſt friend of.</p>
            <p>There are that make three kinds of friendſhip.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Profitable,</hi> where profit is the bond.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Pleaſant,</hi> where pleaſure is the linck of our Affections.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Honeſt,</hi> where virtue is the Load-ſtone. And the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, (by the confeſſion of the very Heathen) is given to the laſt, which (they ſay) is the only perfect friendſhip: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in this friendſhip (above all other) there is a ſimilitude of Manners and Affections. The godly being quickned by the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115539:41"/>ſame Spirit, cannot but mind the ſame thing, and affect the ſame thing; and what gratious Affections are in any of us, the ſame are in others, which partake of the ſame ſpirit:) this prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence it hath that nothing can diſſolve it; no Sword can cut this Gordian knot in two. They love in the truth, and truth will abide for ever. For as Religion ties a man to God, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably, that all the Gates of Hell cannot ſever him; ſo it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites one Chriſtian ſoul, to another, ſo firmly, that no outward occurrences, no tortures, no torments, no temptations, can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it: (as appeares in the Primitive and latter times, when Chriſtians could not be brought one to betray another, by any meanes that could be uſed.) But till Religion tye, and Faith binde, all friendſhip whatſoever, is but (as <hi>Claudius</hi> ſpake of <hi>Seneca's</hi> ſtyle in writing) <hi>as Sand without Lime, or a Beeſom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.</hi> No firmneſs can there be in that love which is not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on God, and godlineſs.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Heathen, have much gloried in thoſe golden payres of ſtedfaſt friends,<note place="margin">Cicero. lib. de amicitia.</note> who have bin ready to lay down their lives one for another (mentioned before.) Howbeit, in all ages and times of the World, they were able to reckon up but very few ſuch; and thoſe (for the moſt part) forged and counterfeit; rather to teach what ſhould be done, then what was truly done; And yet if ſuch friendſhip had bin ever practiſed, and ſuch friends ever extant, it had bin begun and ended in the fleſh, and therefore no other then corrupt and carnal: for where God doth not couple together, and tye the knot, and where the glory of his name is not the mark we aim at, there the life of true friendſhip is wanting. The former examples of ſuppoſed friends, being faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, without the glew of Religion, and the true fear of God, (albeit, it made a goodly ſhew of rare love in the eyes of natural men,) yet it is not to be marched with that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is <hi>inter bonos,</hi> between thoſe that are truly godly, and religions, who have the bond of the ſpirit, and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to joyn them together. You are my old acquaintance, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to a friend of his; but never my true friend, <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Chrſti ſanguine glutinati,</hi> before we were caemented by the blood of Chriſt. And <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, was of this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115539:42"/>in the choyce of friends and ſervants, that none could be true to him that was not true to his God. It is grace that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinates hearts, and ties them faſt together: neither nature, education, benefits, nor any of theſe, not all theſe together that can tie ſo ſtrong a Love-knot, as Faith doth, and will do.</p>
            <p>See then, that you get into the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> ſeek for a Friend in that Society where men are joyned together, in the unity of the Spirit, and ratified by the bond of Faith. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friendſhip we may and ought to have with others (as to cat and drink, buy and ſell, viſit, and have civil commerce with them;) but for this inward and ſtrict friendſhip, whereby out hearts are united in neerneſs and dearneſs; think not to find it any where, but in that Communion. When other friends for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake us, they that are truly Religious, will ſtick faſteſt to us: Say not then in chuſing of thy Friend as <hi>Joram</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jehu,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 9.22.</note> Is <hi>it peace Jehu?</hi> ſo, Is it wealth is it pleaſure? is it honour? if thus, then be thou my Friend: But is it Religion? is it grace? is it vertue? if ſo, then as <hi>Jehu</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jehonadab, the Son of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cab, Give me thy hand.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King 10.15.</note> It is Religion only, and godlineſs that unites ſouls.</p>

            <p>Even in Chriſtianity,<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> there is a difference of love. All the Saints are to be loved (as true Chriſtian friends) of us, yet our hearts may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, (whoſe <hi>Affections</hi> were moſt pure,) had one Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is an ill way that ſome men take to procure Friendſhip, and that is with <hi>the price of ſome ſin:</hi> So <hi>Abraham</hi> by fordid fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ſtoal away the hearts of his Fathers ſubjects, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.5. And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> endeavoured to obtain <hi>Senacheribs</hi> favour by ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, 2 <hi>King</hi> 18.16. But the friendſhip thus purchaſed was not long enjoyned;<note place="margin">2 King. 18.16.</note> for <hi>Senacherib</hi> ſtill perſiſted in his enmity againſt the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as appears in the words following. Yea, ſometimes it falls out that Friends ſo procured with hate us more then they loved us before; As <hi>Ammon</hi> did <hi>Thamar,</hi> after he had defiled her, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.15. And <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth coming to the Crown repenting of his riotous courſe in his youth, bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from the Court all thoſe that had ſeduced him.</p>
            <p>And, there is a way which moſt of the world take to procure Friendſhip, by <hi>large gifts and preſents;</hi> of which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.4. But friendſhip thus obtained (as one ſaith) is but like a fire of ſtraw, or ſtubble;<note place="margin">Pro. 19.4.</note> which burns brightly whilſt it ha's matter to feed upon, but that being neglected, it is ſoon extinguiſhed and comes to nothing. Gifts may be uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue friendſhip; But not to begin it. If thou gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:115539:43"/>
            <p>And yet there is a good way of procuring friends by gifts and benefits (which the world takes no notice of,) commended to us by our Saviour,<note place="margin">Luke 16.9.</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9. <hi>Make you friends of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mammon</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> of the wealth of the world, which moſt men truſt in,) <hi>that they (thoſe Friends) may receive you into everlaſting habitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Friends eſpecially there intended are the <hi>Fodly poor and needy.</hi> Alas (you will ſay) what can ſuch friends do? why more for thee (being godly) then the greateſt Prince in Chriſtendom; by their prayers and teſtimonie of thy Charity. This is a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For albeit the poor are able to do little for us, yet in making them our friends we make many friends at once. <hi>God will be our Friend,</hi> who hath undertaken to recompence us,<note place="margin">Prov. 19.17.</note>

               <hi>Math.</hi> 25.35. (and ſuch a Friend at Court is better then a pennie in a mans purſe.)

There are three, that are very deſirous of our friendſhip, and pretend much love unto us, of whom we muſt take heed. I will name them to you; In the firſt place,</p>
            <p>The firſt deceitful Friend, to be taken heed of, is the <hi>World:</hi> whoſe Friendſhip moſt are much affected with, becauſe of the great Command it hath, and promiſes that it makes to thoſe, who will take it for a Friend; But it is but a <hi>Time-ſerving Friend,</hi> and its friendſhip is very brittle and changeable; ſoon on, and ſoon off. It was ſaid of <hi>Andronicus</hi> the Greek Emperour, whom
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115539:47"/>but yeſterday,<note place="margin">Turk Hiſt.</note> he had uſed moſt kindly, and entolled amongſt his beſt friends, to day he frowned upon, and tyrannized moſt cruelly over; ſo that you might have ſeen the ſame man, the ſame day, to be graced and diſgraced, crowned and beheaded: ſuch is the friendſhip of the world; in the love of it, there is no aſſurance: (as was ſaid of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the firſt Emperour of the Turks): This thouſands have found by ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Beſides, the world is both angry, and covetous. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry it is,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.17.</note> ſo that nothing will pleaſe it, as <hi>Nabals</hi> Servant ſaid of his Maſter, (we may impute it to Age, for it is very old.) And if we add to this, the covetouſneſs of it, we muſt conclude, that the beſt friendſhip of it, is not worth the whiſtling for. Of the friendſhip of it St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Jam. 4.4.</note> Cap. 4.4. No man can be the Friend of God, and friend to It. If the World will be needs our friend, then let us put it in the number of thoſe friends, that are rather to be uſed then truſted, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fleſh</hi> will needs enter into a league of friendſhip with us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.30.</note> and will not (during life) be quite ſhaken off.

            <p>Thirdly; A true Friend is <hi>tryed in Adverſity, Prov.</hi> 17.17.

Thus Chriſt proved his Friendſhip unto us, and ſo we muſt to him.

            <p>Fourthly, a true Friend, is <hi>a Friend to his Friend's</hi> Friend; he will love his Friend's Friend's, and his Friend's Children, for his Friend's ſake: ſo <hi>Davids</hi> Friendſhip to <hi>Ionathan</hi> reached,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 9.1.</note> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Friends and Children of <hi>Ionathan.</hi> So it is here; if we be the Friends of God, we will be the Friends of thoſe that love God; we will count his Friends ours, and his enemies ours as <hi>Iehoſophat</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ahab.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Numb. 20.11.</note> So <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.11. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeemed to ſuſpect <hi>Gods power</hi> in bringing water out of the Rock, as appeares by his words and actions in ſmiting the Rock thrice, which God was much offended with, as appeares by that ſharp reproofe, verſe 12. God likes not that any Friend of his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115539:50"/>ſhould be jealous of him, and ſuſpect his fidelity as hatred, ſo love and confidence are indiviſibly united.</p>
            <p>Secondly; <hi>murmuring at his Reproofes and Corrections,</hi> makes a breach betwixt God and his Friends.

Thus, reſort frequently to his houſe, come often to his Table; for as this begets friendſhip betwixt God and us, ſo it preſerves it being once had.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Stand out for him;</hi> ſpeak in his cauſe. No friend can delight to have his eare the grove of his Friends good name, to hear his friend wronged and be ſilent;<note place="margin">Ecclus. 2.225.</note> Nature did work on the dumb Son of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> when he ſaw his Father ready to be ſlain, ſo that the ſtrings of his tongue did break and he cryed out, <hi>oh kill not</hi> Croeſus.

            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Love ſuch as are God's Friends.</hi> Friends account that that which is done for a friend is done for themſelves. So what is done for the godly, God takes as done to him, God will be offended if they be not regarded,<note place="margin">Math. 25.34, 35, 44, 45.</note> 
               <hi>Math.</hi> 25.45.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Rejoyce in God's friendſhip,</hi> above all things in the world: if you would have it continued. A Heathen being asked where his Treaſure was,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.6.7.</note> anſwered where Cyrus <hi>my friend is:</hi> make Gods love, and friendſhip your chief Treaſure. Thou Lord haſt promiſed all good things to them that love thee, (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) give me thy ſelf and it ſufficeth.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, <hi>keep your hearts, and affections loyall to him: thine own friend and thy father's friend forſake thou not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 27.10.</note> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.10. God is both, let nothing draw our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from him, neither world, fleſh nor Devil, nor any way diminiſh it. Obſerving theſe rules, you may reſt aſſured that as God is your friend, ſo he will continue to be your friend, if we forſake not him he will not forſake us;<note place="margin">2 Chro. 15.2.</note> he never breakes with us firſt.</p>

Now the means to recover friendſhip again, in that caſe, are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>give God a meeting:</hi> when friends fall out and keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe, and come not near one another, they are not like to agree in haſte.</p>

And when we come near we muſt bow our ſelves to the ground ſeaven times, that is, very often. And then ſaith the Text, <hi>Eſau</hi> ran to his Brother and imbraced him, and fell on his neck and kiſſed him: ſo will God much more, if we thus go forth and meet him in his wayes and ordinances.</p>

And thus you ſee how God in diſpenſing of theſe outward things, hath reference to the good and wellfare of his people.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly: It is not without Reference to his own glory, God will have his <hi>Wiſdome</hi> ſeen, in ſuiting every one with an eſtate anſwerable to his ſtation. In the Body there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members, and every member hath its proper uſe and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; There is a Foot, as well as a hand, and head;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> and for the Foot, a ſhoe of leather, is as fitt; as for the Head, a hat of Bever: So in Gods houſe he ſuits men, and gives wages according to their parts, and abilities. And as his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is herein ſeen, ſo hereby, is his <hi>Power</hi> known, in diſpoſing all things according to his own will, (not our pleaſure,) <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.17.18.

               </label> Firſt, <hi>David</hi> may be underſtood as ſpeaking of a trade of Begging, or a conſtant courſe of ſtreet-beggery, (which in theſe dayes is become a kind of a Calling, and whereof there is a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, ſome Parents bring up their Children to it, others take Apprentices to learne them the Trade. They teach them how to look, what to ſay, how to lye, how to cry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) The Prophet never knew any Godly man, to be of this Profeſſion, or to drive this Trade. The Profeſſion, and ſtate of begging was prohibited by the law of God, and accurſed by him; ſo that no Godly man would offend againſt that Law, and bring that Curſe upon himſelfe. Such are ſo farr from being <hi>Righteous,</hi> as that they live without God in the world, and are like to periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, in the world to come; being Atheiſts, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Sabbath-breakers, Theeves, Whoremongers; the worſt of Infernall Spirits have not leſſe ſenſe of Piety, but more ſenſe of a Diety then theſe. Theſe are the Vermin of the Common-wealth, and ſhould not be ſuffered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that which Impotent poor ſhould have: But why touch I theſe?</p>
            <p>Secondly; <hi>David</hi> may be underſtood as ſpeaking of his own experience: for he ſaith not, that the Righteous were never dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115539:56"/>to ſo bad an Exigent as to begg their bread; but that <hi>he never ſaw it.</hi> And indeed it is a rare, and unuſuall thing, to ſee;<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> (Albeit it may ſo fall out), (for we read of <hi>Lazarus</hi> lying at <hi>Dives</hi> his gate) and I believe the Eldeſt man living, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not point out many inſtances. However, <hi>David</hi> in all his time, never <hi>ſaw it</hi> that a truly righteous perſon, was brought (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to want, yet not) to beggery.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; <hi>David</hi> may be underſtood as ſpeaking of the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> and <hi>their ſeed both:</hi> for if God be ſo pleaſed to lay this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction on any of his ſervants, to chaſtiſe them for their ſins, or for the tryall of their graces; yet God in mercy remembers their Poſterity; (if they walk in obedience before him) and <hi>his ſeed ſhall inherit the bleſſing.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Prophet's meaning may be this, that albeit they were brought to ſuch extremity of want as to begg their bread, yet he never <hi>ſaw them to be forſaken in that extreamity,</hi> but God hath ſtirred up the hearts, of ſome good people, (even then) to ſuccour them, and relieve them: yea he himſelf, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then fail, will be the reliever of them, (as he was of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> who had his wants ſupplied, and was ſuccoured by God, (as his name imported.<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note>) And when they are moſt ſcanted, they are not forſaken: for what they are ſcanted in <hi>Temporals,</hi> they are ſupplyed in <hi>Spirituals.</hi> And this (I take to be moſt genuine, and it) agrees well, with the former <hi>Aphoriſm; though they fall into outward miſery, yet God puts to his helping hand.</hi> So much for the clearing of the point.

Examine all Hiſtory, (ſacred and prophane) and you ſhall find that the moſt loathſome and abominable creatures that ever breathed aire, or ſaw the Sun, have ſayled through the Sea of the world, in the talleſt and greateſt veſſels. And yet (as one ſpeaks of the territory of the great <hi>Turk</hi>) they are but as a little bone caſt to that great Dog: and indeed were they any better then bones, the Doggs of the world ſhould never have them; were they bread, Gods children ſhould never be without them.</p>
            <p>There is indeed a <hi>Common love</hi> extended to Man and Beaſt, of which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6.<note place="margin">Pſal. 36.6.

A man may ſafely conclude God is good to me, and loveth me, elſe he would not provide for me as he doth: but he cannot conclude God loveth me with that love which he beareth to his Children, becauſe of theſe things. Can a Traytor comfort himſelf in his Princes favour, becauſe he hath good lodging and good diet provided for him in the Tower, till matters be ripe, and all things ready for his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, and execution? or the Oxe that is fatted (if it had Reaſon to diſcourſe) to ſay, My owner loves me, in putting me in paſtures where I feed up to the very eyes?

Put caſe a man hath a fair piece of Evidence, duly ſealed, authentically teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and delivered; if he have no land to hold by it, or Title to recover by it, would he be any whit the better for it? Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, are Evidences, to them who have a Title: So when a man hath a good Title to Heaven, when he hath a teſtimony of Gods ſpirituall Bleſſings, in the temporall, then are theſe temporall bleſſings good evidences: Otherwiſe, if thou haſt not the Grace of God, and ſpirituall bleſſings with theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall; thou art not the nearer happineſſe, for earthly abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Theſe things are but as an Evidence in his hands who hath no Title: and that is very ſuſpitious, ſuch a one may well be thought, to have embezeled or purloyed thoſe Evidences: to have forged or counterfeited them, and ſo may be called to an account for them: ſo thoſe who have temporall bleſſings, without ſpirituall; they are but counterſeit, they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a minutes peace of Conſcience, nor a minutes refreſhing of the ſoul hereafter: But a heavy account muſt be made, how we got them, and how we employed them.</p>

            <p>And this muſt needs be ſo, for firſt that which you have, (be it but a little) yet it is your own, you have the higheſt title to it, that can be had; for you hold all <hi>in Capite</hi> as the Apoſtle ſheweth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. this the wicked have not,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.21.23.

            <p>Secondly, that which you have; ſhall do you good, and no hurt, it is ſanctified unto you, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 5. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhewes, that no creature is good, but to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and know the truth, and renders that as a reaſon, for <hi>it is ſanctified by the Word and by Prayer.</hi> What you have, you have without ſorrow, without the curſe: your want and poverty, ſhall be no hindrance to your happineſſe; but it ſhall further it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35. Now it is otherwiſe with the wicked, (as hath bin ſhewed,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.37.</note>) ſhould the caſe be put unto you whether a poor and needy condition, may help a man to Heaven; Or a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115539:59"/>and opulent eſtate, that may haſten a man to Hell, is to be preferred; would it not be ſoon determined?</p>
            <p n="3">3. What you have, you have with love, which giveth a ſweet reliſh to all we have.

But the wicked have not what they have with <hi>Gods</hi> ſpeciall love, as was ſaid even now. You ſee then, it is impoſſible for you to be miſerable in your worſt condition, and that your worſt is better then the beſt of any other.

The richeſt that is, ſhall go out of the world as poor as thy ſelf, and came as naked into it as did thy ſelf, ſo that thou haſt no cauſe to complain. Some Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands uſe to ſay to their wives, I ſhall leave you as well as I found you; you are for preſent better; Beſides you deſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that you have, thou doſt not earn that bit of bread thou eateſt. Is not all thou haſt of Gift and Almes? and ſhall a Beggar repine at the Alms that is given him? much more cauſe thou haſt to bleſſe God that thou art ſo well dealt withall, than to repine or grieve that thou art no better. Doth God lay loſſes on thee? why, he might have left thee without a ragg on thy back. Doth he afflict with ſickneſſe? he might with death, &amp;c. In what want ſoever we are, or what diſtreſſe ſoever we lye under, we may bleſſe God that it is no worſe with us: our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are far leſſe,<note place="margin">Lament. 3.22.

And then remember withall, how many there are who deſerve better then thy ſelf, who yet come ſhort of thee in outward things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without cloaths; without bed; without harbour; without work; without health; without ſtrength; <hi>Lactantius</hi> (that Chriſtian <hi>Cicero,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> calls him,) was ſo needy that he

            <p>Sometimes, he hath wrought extraordinarily, and, by ſtrange wayes, ſupplyed the wants of his: As in feeding of <hi>Eliah</hi> by Ravens, (who naturally hate her own brood,<note place="margin">1 King. 17.5, 6.</note> and were more likely in that time of famine to have fed upon his dead carkaſſe, then to have fed him).

            <p>All Nations, and People in the world, have ſet a high price on Bread: When the Aegyptians wanted bred, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with all their mony for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.14. and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with that, but with all their Cattell, their Land,<note place="margin">Gen. 47.14. verſ. 17.19.</note> and themſelves too, to purchaſe it, <hi>verſe.</hi> 17.19.

And whereas ſome Nations have abſtained from ſome kind of meates, (as the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> do at this day; And <hi>Papiſts</hi> from fleſh and white-meats in time of Lent) yet no Nation, or people (except Caniballs) abſtaine from Bread.

Nor was the uſe of Bread ever forbad by any Politique Law; (as the uſe of other meates have been,) from the very beginning of the world, Bread was had in great account, and was in uſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.2. and 14.18.

            <p>There are four Creatures mentioned by <hi>Joel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joel. 1.4.</note> (great enemies to Tillage,) which did waſte the Corne, and devoure the harveſt of the Field. The <hi>Palmer-worm,</hi> the <hi>Locuſt</hi> or <hi>Graſhopper,</hi> the <hi>Canker-Worm,</hi> and the <hi>Catterpillar:</hi> what one left, the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and ſo brought great dearth, and ſcarcity upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and was a meanes of the overthrow of their Country.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Palmer-worm,</hi> was a flying Creature, and ſo called from his wandering diſpoſition. To which we may aptly reſemble the <hi>mighty Nimrods</hi> of our time: Of this <hi>Nimrod</hi> we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.8.9.10. he was the Son of <hi>Chus:</hi> and <hi>Nimrod</hi> ſignifies <hi>Rebellious;</hi> he was one that ſought to make himſelf great,<note place="margin">Gen. 10.8, 9, 10.</note> (even to a Proverb, verſe 9.) he was a mighty Hunter. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewes, (in the verſe following,) he hunted for a <hi>Kingdom.</hi> But this Hunting in Scripture, is applyed to the hunting of men, by <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion, Ier.</hi> 16.16. Hunters are no good Friends to the Husbandman; they fling open gaps, ride over the Corne;<note place="margin">Ier. 16.16.</note> not ſuffering what is ſown, to come to ripeneſſe, and perfection: It was a juſt puniſhment that ſometimes <hi>Frederick,</hi> Duke of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onie</hi> impoſed on ſome of his followers, for that fault, who gave charge, that they ſhould not have a bit of bread to ſupper, (with their meſſes of meat,) that they might know the worth of that good Creature, which they ſpoiled: But myſtically the <hi>Oppreſſor</hi> is a far worſe Hunter, then theſe; he imployes both arme, and braine, to hunt the poore out of his habitation, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.2. It is a good Item that <hi>Solomon</hi> gives to theſe,<note place="margin">Mic. 2.2. Pro. 23.10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 23.10, 11. <hi>enter not into the Fields of the Fatherleſſe,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> to wrong them and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them) <hi>For their Redeemer is strong, and he will plead their cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:115539:63"/>
            <p>Secondly; the <hi>Locuſt</hi> is another Creature that is an enemie to Corne.<note place="margin">Amos 7.1.</note> Theſe devoure the Fruit of the Earth, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.1. eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>green thing</hi> they eate, and in <hi>hard weather, lye under hedges.</hi> They ſay of this Creature, that it is all Belly, (which is joyned to his mouth, and endeth at his taile.) Our <hi>Monopolists, Ingroſſers,</hi> and <hi>Hoarders</hi> up of Corne, (and others of that make) may be reſembled to theſe <hi>Locuſts:</hi> they get commodities into their own hands, (what Corne they can, into their own Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,) purpoſely to make dearth, and ſo a prey of the poore.</p>
            <p>Such were they, that we read of, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.4, 5, 6. They had hoarded up Corne to make it deare,<note place="margin">Amos 8.4.5, 6.</note> and now the Markets grew quick, they muſt bring it forth, in all haſte, but it was only to make a prey of the poor and needy. Had they <hi>(with Ioſeph)</hi> bought up the ſuperfluitie of plenty, to prevent a dearth; or had they laid up,<note place="margin">Gen. 41.47.48</note> out of the abundance of one yeare to prevent ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in another; this had been a wiſe and diſcreet providence. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> by ſuch a Provident care, brought it to paſſe, that when a dearth was in all other Lands, there was Bread to be had in the Land of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> But when the Markets are unfurniſhed, then to buy up, or hoard up, to raiſe the price; this is an unlawfull practiſe,<note place="margin">Pro. 11.26.</note> and followed with a curſe, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.26. And Gods curſe as well as the Poor's follows it. We read, in Henry the 3d. his dayes of one <hi>Walter Grey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stow. Chron.</note> 
               <hi>Arch-Biſhop of Yorke,</hi> who in a great dearth had five years Corn hoarded up; and fearing leſt it ſhould be deſtroyed by Vermine, gave command that it ſhould be delivered to Husband-men that dwelt in his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, upon condition to pay as much new Corne at Harveſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; But when they came to a great ſtack of Corn, nigh to the Town of <hi>Ripon,</hi> (belonging to the Arch-Biſhop) intending to threſh it out, multitude of Serpents, Toads, Adders, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſheaves, ſo that the Bailiffs were enforced to ſet it all on fire, to conſume thoſe venomous creatures that were in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Canker-worme,</hi> is another devourer and ſpoiler of Corne,<note place="margin">Nah. 3.16.</note> that ſpoileth, and then flyeth away (ſaith <hi>Nahum.</hi>) To this we may reſemble the <hi>mercileſſe and cruell Landlord,</hi> who by racking Rents, exceſſive fines, impoſition of Carriages (more
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115539:63"/>than by Covenant was agreed on,) doth ſo tenter-ſtretch the poor Tillager, that he is never his own man again. Queſtionles Lands and Rents, may be improved; ſo that it be with charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minds, and that the Tenant may both pay his Rent, and comfortably ſubſiſt by his labours, and maintain himſelf and his, in an honeſt ſort; Otherwiſe ſuch <hi>Landlords</hi> do but grind the faces of the poore, chop them ſmall as herbs for the Pot, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.3. they <hi>ſeethe a Kid in the Mothers milk,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mich. 3.3. Exod. 23.19.</note> old and young toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in one anothers blood. And in rayſing their Rents, they do their utmoſt endeavours to raiſe the Markets, (for how elſe can Tenants pay their Rents?) and in ſo doing, they ſeek to bring a dearth upon the Land.</p>
            <p>The laſt, of theſe waſting Creatures, is the <hi>Catterpillar,</hi> which in the Eaſt, was a horned worme with 16. Feete, (termed by <hi>Jeremiah, the Rough Catterpillar,</hi>) this was a great ſpoyler,<note place="margin">Jer. 21.27. Pſal. 78.46. &amp; 105.34.</note> and waſter of Corne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.46. &amp; 105.34, And ſuch a horned worme is the <hi>Depopulatour,</hi> (which abound moſt in the North-Eaſt) they throw down whole Villages, and inſtead of one or two hundred Perſons, who have there lived, and comfortably maintained themſelves, and Families; now no more is to be ſeen, then a <hi>Sheephard,</hi> and <hi>his Dog.</hi> Theſe do not only take away the gleanings from the poore,<note place="margin">Job. 24.10. Deut. 24.19. Iſay. 5.8.</note> 
               <hi>Job.</hi> 24.10. (Contrary to the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.19.) but the fields and all, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 5.8.</p>
            <p>And ſuch a horned Worme, would the <hi>Leveller</hi> have been, <hi>in the Weſt,</hi> who pull'd up hedges, removed Land-marks, filling up ditches, and laying all Common (as in the inſurrection of <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi> and <hi>Iack Straw,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Richard the ſecond,</hi>) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon other mens labours, bringing confuſion on Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
            <p>If theſe Hoggs, had not been rung, by good laws made againſt them, and juſt puniſhment inflicted on them; they would (as it is thought) by this time, not only have rooted up <hi>Townes</hi> and <hi>Houſes,</hi> but <hi>Churches</hi> too; And yet it is to be feared, that their Rings are broken off, for they fall (in ſome places) to rooting afreſh. Thus by theſe four Creatures the plenty of Corne comes to be waſted, and want, and ſcarcity is brought upon us inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; For what the <hi>Palmer-Worme</hi> leaves, the <hi>Locuſt</hi> eats up, what the <hi>Locust</hi> leaves, the <hi>Canker-Worme</hi> devoures, and what
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115539:64"/>that leaves, is conſumed by the <hi>Catterpiller.</hi> All together are enough to devour up the plenty of a Land.</p>
            <p>As theſe four Creatures ſwarme, in the Kingdom; ſo in our Pariſhes, Townes, Villages, Families, the like kind of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine may be met withall. How many looſe, and debauched Perſons are there amongſt us, who by their vitious and ſinfull courſes bring themſelves and theirs, to a morſell of bread? as</p>
            <p>Firſt by <hi>Whoredome.</hi> This the wiſe man obſerved in his time,<note place="margin">Pro. 29.7.</note> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.3. <hi>he that keepeth company with Harlots ſpendeth his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi> Or he that <hi>feedeth</hi> Harlots (for ſo the words may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and are in ſome tranſlations,) for they ſtick like Horſe-Leaches, till they have fed, and filled themſelves; and then they fall off, when they have emptyed thoſe who fed them. So <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.26. <hi>by the meanes of a whoriſh woman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 6.26.</note> 
               <hi>a man is brought to a morſell of bread;</hi> To a bit or a ſcrap of it: Gods curſe is upon a mans eſtate, and labours, for this ſin; Beſides it is a <hi>coſtly ſin,</hi> (though it be baſe and brutiſh,) and bought at the higheſt rate: the Wife, and many Children are not ſo chargeable as one Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot is: A price ſhe ſets on her body: none on her ſoul, (that ſhe gives away.) Theſe are like the <hi>Palmer-Worm,</hi> for their gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and wandering diſpoſition,<note place="margin">Prov. 11.7. Jude 7.</note> 
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.7. No fleſh pleaſes them, ſo well as <hi>ſtrange fleſh, Jude</hi> 7. For ſuch is reſerved the <hi>Vengeance of eternall Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">Prov. 23.21.</note> by <hi>Drunkenneſſe, Pro.</hi> 23.21. <hi>the Drunkard</hi> and <hi>Glutton ſhall ſurely come to poverty.</hi> A puniſhment threatened to the Drunkards of <hi>Judah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joel. 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>Ioel.</hi> 1.5. God brought upon them a time of dearth, and famine, for abuſing their plenty in exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive drinking. Experience verifies this, in moſt places, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes; and I doubt not but you can produce Inſtances (more then enough.) If you would keep your Town from beggery, have a care to ſuppreſſe this ſin, what may be. The onely way to deſtroy ſome Vermine, is to ſhave off the hair; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy noyſome foules, is to deſtroy their neſts. So the way to ſuppreſſe Drunkenneſſe is to put down their harbours, where the diſſolute wretch ſits ſecurely, and buyes beggery at a deare rate: the Wife and Children being at home wanting bread, whilſt he ſpends <hi>all his ſubstance,</hi> (his whole daye's earnings) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115539:64"/>in drink. The provident care of our Governours, hath made good lawes for the reſtraining of this vice, and few of our Ale houſe-keepers, but are bound to ſuffer no drunkenneſſe in their houſes: yet (they muſt acknowledge) if it were not for their old <hi>Guest drunkenneſſe,</hi> they might ſhut up their doores, and ſhould not be able to pay their Rent. Theſe <hi>Drunkards</hi> are as thoſe <hi>Crowned Locusts</hi> mentioned, <hi>Nahum</hi> 3.17. and they have <hi>great Graſhoppers</hi> for their <hi>Captains,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nah. 3.17,</note> which Camp in the hedges in cold day; yet may not Officers forbear to beat theſe hedges. If Officers be mild, and the Drunkard merry, little Reformation in our Townes may be expected of this vice.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>I delneſſe</hi> is another meanes to bring a man to the want of bread, Prov. 20.4, <hi>The ſluggard will not plough by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the cold, therefore ſhall be begg in Havest and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> By <hi>plowing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 20.4.</note> the workes of a mans calling is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, (that calling being put for the reſt of his labours) and by <hi>Winter</hi> underſtand all ſeaſons that ſeem hard, or troubleſome, to him, that would be at eaſe; and eat the bread of Idleneſſe. Such a one in Harveſt, ſhall reap the fruit of his ſloathfulneſſe, as others do of their Labour: theirs ſhall be plenty, his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and want; When others fill their boſomes <hi>binding up their ſheaves,</hi> he ſhall beg for gleanings, and be denyed,<note place="margin">Pſal. 126. P.ov. 6.9, 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. want ſhall come on ſuch, <hi>like an armed man,</hi> there ſhall be no reſiſting of it. Theſe are but as <hi>Canker wormes</hi> in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they inhabit, every green thing they ſpoil and then fly away, <hi>Nahum</hi> 3.16. leaving their charge to the Pariſh.<note place="margin">Nah. 3.16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Prodigality</hi> and waſtfulneſſe, is another devourer, and brings their want upon men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.9. <hi>He is Brother to the ſlouthfull;</hi> Both give Beggary for their Armes,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.9.</note> Dr. <hi>Jerm. in loc.</hi> onely this is the difference; The <hi>Prodigall</hi> runs to beggary, and the idle and ſloathfull perſon, ſits ſtill till it comes to him. We have an example in that prodigall, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.11. He was a waſter of his Portion of Goods that his Father gave him,<note place="margin">Luke 15.13.</note> and that brought him (as you may read afterwards) to the Hogs-trough. It is ill trade that Prodigality drives; waſters will be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſuch Prodigalls may be reſembled to the <hi>Catterpillar:</hi> for albeit they have but one hand to receive, yet they have many feet, which carry them to all exceſſe of Ryot; they run with
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115539:65"/>them, with all the might they have, and (like an hour-glaſſe turned up) they never leave running till all be out. All theſe, both in <hi>Publique</hi> and in <hi>Private,</hi> take the way to inflict bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs upon a Land, and bring the want of bread both on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others; which is ſo great a Judgement.</p>

            <p>Our own <hi>Chronicles,</hi> preſent unto our view the gaſtly Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Famine: we of this Nation have bin often ſmitten with this ſcourge.

Hiſt.</note> Parents did eat the fleſh of their own Children, which they hid in ſecret places: And Theeves newly brought into the Goal were torn in pieces: and eaten half alive, by thoſe who had bin longer there. Many other terrible famines, are mentioned, (as in the dayes of <hi>Henry the ſixth,</hi> and in the dayes of <hi>Henry the Eighth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1440.1527.</note> and many times ſince, God hath ſent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine amongſt us, to cleanſe thoſe teeth that have bin furred and fowled with exceſſe.)</p>
            <p>If you think I preſent the face of famine to you at too far a diſtance,<note place="margin">At the ſiege of Colcheſter.</note> I will bring it nearer and beſeech you to veiw it; in our near Neighbours glaſſe. Was not Dogs-fleſh, and Cat-fleſh, Rats, Mice, &amp;c. in that ſtreight ſiege of theirs, as dainties eſteemed with them? Oh the miſeries that they ſuffered, and had not God remembred them in mercy, to what extreamities they might have bin brought, the Lord onely knoweth. But God hath both freed them,<note place="margin">In the Year <hi>1654.</hi> and <hi>1655.</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, the friendſhip of our earthly Friends, <hi>proves</hi> (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times) <hi>vain,</hi> for <hi>every man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity,</hi>

And their purpoſes and promiſes prove no better; they fail us in undertaking for us, ſometimes above abilities; or elſe through heedleſneſſe, and forgetfulneſſe, or other weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, fruſtrating their good intentions.

It is a groſſe deceit, for any good man to think that their caſe is hard, becauſe they are without mony, without ſtock, without meanes. His caſe is hard, that hath a hard heart, and either cannot pray, or will not pray, but it cannot be hard with him that can pray, and doth pray; which will remedy all.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> only, for a <hi>Time;</hi> if it be liberall and free, is called <hi>Commodation,</hi> or lending to Uſe; (the property being ſtill retayned.) But if it be for <hi>Recompence,</hi> then it is called <hi>Location</hi> or letting to Hire.</p>
            <p>That which is not only of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> but of <hi>Property</hi> alſo; if it be liberall and Free, is called <hi>Mutuation</hi> or lending to ſpend, if it be <hi>Illiberall,</hi> and for gaine it is called <hi>

            <p>Now the difference is to be taken notice of betwixt theſe two kindes of Lendings;<note place="margin">Mutuatio Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodatio.</note> 
               <hi>Mutuating,</hi> and <hi>Accommodating.</hi> When any doth <hi>mutuum dare,</hi> mutuate, he looks but for his own againe, in <hi>eadem ſpecie,</hi> in the ſame kind. As when one lends Bread, Corne, Mony, to a Friend; he lends it not with condition to have the very ſelfe ſame Loaves againe, or graines of Corne, or pieces of Silver againe that were lent; but with condition that it ſhould be repayed in the like kind, Bread for Bread: Corne for Corne (of the ſame kind and goodneſſe): Mony for Mony ſo much, for ſo much; For here the <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of the thing, lent, is transferred from the <hi>Lender</hi> to the <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower;</hi> otherwiſe a man could not uſe them, in regard that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115539:87"/>the <hi>Uſe,</hi> and the <hi>Property,</hi> cannot beſevered. And therefore this kind of Lending is called <hi>mutuum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heming. in Jac. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> (in which too words <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi> are contracted into one.) As if the Lender ſhould ſay, this that is <hi>mine,</hi> I now make it <hi>thine,</hi> for a time; thine to do with what thou wilt: thine in <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> both to lend, and ſpend, to give, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> ſo thine, (that during the time of the loane of it) I will not call thee to an account for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is thine. And this kind of lending is only of ſuch things as are ſpent in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> and paſſe from man to man by number, weight, or meaſure.</p>
            <p>Now when a man <hi>Accommodates,</hi> he looks to receive that which he lends, in <hi>Individuo;</hi> for as much as the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is only transferred, but not the <hi>Property,</hi> unto the Borrower, ſo that he cannot every way uſe it as his own, he cannot ſell it, exchange it, or beſtow it on whom he pleaſe. Should a man lend his Friend, his <hi>Horſe;</hi> he may not, by vertue of that Lending, ſell him to another, nor exchange him with another; for as much as the Lender did not make his Friend the owner of the beaſt, by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the <hi>Property</hi> or <hi>dominion</hi> unto him, he only yeilds the <hi>Uſe</hi> of it for a <hi>time,</hi> and when the time is expired, he expects the ſame Beaſt againe, (and no other) in the roome of him. Now the Lending which our Text ſpeaks of, is of the former kind call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Mutuation,</hi> being of ſuch things, whoſe uſe conſiſts in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of their ſubſtance, and whereof both <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> are paſſed over for a Time only, and not Perpetually; which Time being expired, the borrower is to reſtore the Principall, not the ſelfe ſame particular, or individuall loafe, or loaves, of bread; but ſo much in the ſame kind, or the ſame in valew.</p>

            <p>By this deſcription of <hi>Lending</hi> it appeares, how it differs from all other Contracts: as firſt from <hi>Lettings,</hi> for in that we paſſe over the Uſe of a thing for a certaine price, retayning ſtill the <hi>Property,</hi> but in this we many times paſſe over both Uſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115539:88"/>and Property: but whether one, or both, it is alwayes without price.</p>
            <p>It differs from <hi>ſelling:</hi> For that is a contract by which a thing is transferred, from one to another for a certaine price, and that for ever: both agree in the transferring and alienating the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, with the Uſe; but herein they differ, the one is <hi>Liberall,</hi> the other <hi>not;</hi> the one is <hi>Temporall,</hi> the other for <hi>ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It differs from <hi>Exchange;</hi> which is the yeilding of one thing for another; As a <hi>Horſe</hi> for a <hi>Cow,</hi> or this Horſe, for that Barly, gold for Silver, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> But when I lend, I look that the like ſhould be reſtored, in the ſame <hi>kind,</hi> and that at the <hi>time</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>It differs from <hi>Giving:</hi> in both there is a free paſſing over both Uſe, and Property; But he that gives me this, or that, gives it me with this intent, that it ſhould become mine, and never be returned to him againe; but ſo doth not the Lender, in that which he paſſeth over unto me. Theſe things I thought good to premiſe, that we may make better way to what I intend to propound unto you from hence, and make uſe of. The point ſhall be,</p>

            <p>This man doth intimate as much, in comming to his Friend to borrow, and prefacing his Requeſt with ſuch a Compellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as <hi>Friend:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Wert thou not my Friend, I could not be ſo bold, but being my Friend, do ſo much for me for <hi>Friendſhip ſake:</hi> as to <hi>Lend me three Loaves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When God brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he wills <hi>Moſes</hi> that the people ſhould borrow every one of his neighbour, Jewels of Silver, and Jewels of Gold; a likely thing, (might the people ſay,) that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> will lend to us their Jewells whom they ſo much hate, Well (ſayes God,) I <hi>will give this people fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in their ſight,</hi> ſo that they ſhall lend unto them what they deſire.

            <p>Secondly, take notice, that to deny to lend, is to offend againſt <hi>humane ſociety,</hi> which cannot ſubſiſt without it. Uſurers (and the Patrons of it) ſay ſo of Uſury. It is ſo neceſſary, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths cannot ſtand without the practiſe of it: Without <hi>lending</hi> (indeed) they cannot, but without <hi>Vſury,</hi> they both
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115539:91"/>might, and ought. Wherefore hath God made men ſociable Creatures but to be helpfull one unto another upon ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, know that it is a <hi>greater ſin,</hi> not to <hi>lend</hi> unto thy Friend, and Neighbour, then to be an <hi>Uſurer</hi> unto him: As it is a greater offence; to deny food to him that is almoſt famiſhed, then to ſell it unto him at an unreaſonable rate. Therefore many States, tollerate Uſury, for the good, both of the Borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Lender: Of the <hi>Borrower,</hi> becauſe his neceſſity is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſuch, that it is farr better to borrow upon Uſury, then not to borrow at all: Of the <hi>Lender</hi> becauſe to lend upon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Uſery, to them that muſt needs borrow, is a leſſe ſin, then not to lend at all. And yet how many are there, who will cry out upon the <hi>Vſurer,</hi> when they themſelves are worſe, in not being upon neceſſary occaſion a <hi>Lender</hi> unto their Neighbour? Looke then upon this duty, not as arbitrary, and left to your own choyce, whether you will lend or not: for if our Brethrens neceſſities require it, we ſtand bound unto it; and reſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that God will require it of us, if we do it not.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, borrow with a reſolution to reſtore what is lent thee, and that at the time appointed. There are in theſe dayes (more then a few,) who by faire words and colourable pretences, and under the Cloake of Religion, creepe into their Neighbours bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, borrow mony, take up wares of credit, (as far as they can be truſted,) never purpoſing to pay, but reſolving before hand, that ſo ſoon as they have gotten their Neighbours goods into their own poſſeſſion, voluntarily to break and turn <hi>Banck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts,</hi> and then an agreement muſt be ſought with Creditors, and compoſition made for a third, fifth, or tenth part of what was borrowed: by which wicked courſe, many a conſcionable, and well-minded <hi>Lender</hi> hath been brought to much want; when theſe unjuſt, and baſe-minded <hi>Borrowers</hi> have lived like Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men upon their ſtollen goods, and the ſweat of other mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

            <p>Secondly, repay truly and at the time appointed, abuſe not thy Friend in denying the debt, and putting him to prove it, (which is the practiſe of too many) nor keep it from him, with a ſtrong hand, longer then the time contracted for (which is the practiſe of more.)

            <p>But withall he tells us, that we muſt not proceed alike in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with Adverſaries, that deny the Truth, and in teaching and exhorting a Religious Auditory, that do already believe the Truth.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115539:106"/>God that muſt give the bleſſing: give me leave then to do the one, and leave we the ſucceſſe to him.</p>
            <p>There are two bounds which the Holy Ghoſt hath made to hem, and keep in, the unruly deſires of men, (which are as it were the pale, or Parke to keep theſe unruly Bucks within their compaſſe.) They concerne God, or our <hi>ſelves.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, for <hi>worldly things.</hi> No more are to be deſired by us of them, then God hath required us to ſeek, and promiſed to give. Things <hi>neceſſary</hi> (which concernes our <hi>Perſons,</hi> and tends to the <hi>preſervation of Nature</hi> and maintenance of our Bodyes in health, ſtrength, and chearfullneſſe, or which concernes our <hi>Places</hi> and conditions, (without which our civil conditions cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably mainteyned, neither in reſpect of our ſelves, nor others depending on us,) may be deſired and prayed for, but not things <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> (for then they goe beyond the bounds that God hath ſet them,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.8.</note>) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. And exceed the meaſure of thoſe ends, for which they were ordeyned, (which are to glorifie God, mainteyne our ſelves, and relieve others) and ſo cannot be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

If <hi>Kings</hi> may not multiply above that which is enough, for the eſtate of a King; what prerogative have any other to do it? It is true, That is needfull, and may be deſired by a man of one calling and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that may not by another, that is of a divers condition, and calling, becauſe reſpective and conditionall neceſſities follow the calling and condition of men. A King hath need of greater meanes to mainteyne his eſtate then any ſubject: and amongſt ſubjects, one may have more need then another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different callings (as there are warme dayes in Winter, and cold in Summer, reſpecting the ſeaſon of the yeare; ſo there may be poore Lords, and rich Coblers, in reſpect of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtates) yea amongſt men of the ſame Rank, and place, that may be deſired as <hi>neceſſary</hi> for one, which may be <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> for another. <hi>Timotheus</hi> his complexion and ſtate of body, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that neſſeſſarily,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.23.</note> that another Miniſter's condition did not, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23. Times, places, and conditions of men do much alter the caſe. Nor are we to judge what is needfull and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for our Perſons, or callings by our own covetous conceits, (for they have no limits) but what the godly of our rank and place, who are wiſe and frugall, declare by their practiſe to be needfull.

            <p>Secondly, as our deſires reſpect things ſpirituall, ſo we are to make uſe of the former rules of Limitation, both in the <hi>removing</hi> of evill, and <hi>obteyning</hi> of good.</p>
            <p>Firſt in deſiring to have evill removed, our deſires are to be ordered aright; And here we muſt diſtinguiſh of evil, which is of two ſorts, firſt of Sin, ſecond of Puniſhment; Evill that we do, and evill that we ſuffer. For the <hi>Evill of ſin,</hi> here our deſires are not to be limited, for as much as all Sin is a breach of Gods law; and however Sin will be committed by us in this Life, yet God hath forbidden all, as well as any, and our deſires ſhould reach farther then our abilities; we ſhould deſire to be freed from every wicked way, and ſinfull worke, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.128. &amp; 66.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Evill that we ſuffer,</hi> that is of two ſorts, the <hi>Evill</hi> of <hi>Temptation,</hi> or the <hi>Evill of Affliction,</hi> but neither of theſe are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to be prayed againſt, for as much as it is Gods revealed will that we muſt taſte of them. As for Temptation to Sin from Sathan as it is a motion, and ſolicitation to evill, it is to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt, but under correction, if it may ſtand with Gods good will and pleaſure; but ſo farr forth as it is a meanes to draw away our hearts from God, and turne us out of the way to Life, we are to deſire the Lord abſolutely to keep us from them, St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7, 8.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8. to be (as it ſeemes) freed from the temptations of Sathan, but it is hard to ſay what St. <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth by that, however the words carry an Argument againſt abſolute praying, againſt all Temptations; <hi>my grace</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>is ſufficient for thee,</hi> I have as many Antidotes, as the Divell hath Poyſons; I have as much mercy, as the Divell hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; There muſt be Temptations, but Temptations add to Mine and to thy glory; God ſhould loſe by it, and we ſhould loſe by it, if there were no Temptations.<note place="margin">Math. 6.13.</note> That petition, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.13. is not meant from being aſſaulted by any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or being attempted to evill, but from being ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by it, ſo that we are not us utterly, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, to pray againſt temptations, as we are againſt Sin.</p>
            <pb n="182" facs="tcp:115539:108"/>
            <p>As for <hi>Afflictions,</hi> they are laid upon us by the hand of God, all come from him, and not to be deſpiſed not prayed againſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5, 6, 7. only ſo farr forth it is lawfull to pray againſt them,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.5, 6, 7.</note> as they are the puniſhments of a angry <hi>God,</hi> a part of the Curſe, and a meanes to drive us to impatiency. And thus of limiting of our deſires, in reſpect of <hi>Evill:</hi> Now of the Rules of Limitation, in reſpect of <hi>Good,</hi> a word or two.</p>
            <p>In good things our deſires ought to be infinitely carryed after them (for this is the <hi>meaſure</hi> of our deſires in theſe things, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet them <hi>above meaſure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.31. &amp; 14.1.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. and 14.1.) An unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited deſire is only there requiſite, where the <hi>Object</hi> thereof is <hi>Infinite,</hi> and ordeyned to perfect mans nature, but not where it is only a meanes appointed for his benefit, and comfort; Here then we muſt diſtinguiſh between ſuch ſpirituall things, which are <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to ſalvation: thoſe <hi>God</hi> hath abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give to his, and theſe may, yea muſt <hi>abſolutely</hi> be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſought for. And the <hi>Degrees of thoſe Graces</hi> that admitt of degrees, theſe may not abſolutely be deſired <hi>in every degree;</hi> becauſe it is the grace it ſelf, and not the degree that is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Conſolation</hi> lyes much in the <hi>Comparative degree,</hi> but our <hi>Salvation</hi> lyes in the <hi>Poſitive. God</hi> doth diſpenſe with his gifts, and graces to every one as he ſees fitt, to one this meaſure, to another that.

            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:115539:113"/>
            <p>To ſtirr us up to hold this faire quarter in Love, and Friendſhip, I ſhall commend a few things to your ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, remember that all Societies are like Arch-buildings (as one ſpeaketh) in which, unleſſe every ſtone upholds the other, the whole frame muſt ſuddenly fall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as affection is mutuall, ſo the gaine is reciprocall. As in a building, the Walls beare up the Roofe, and the Roofe keepes the Wall and Timber from rotting. It was a good ſaying of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> Naturally a man hath but one head to adviſe him, one tongue to ſpeak for him, two eyes to ſee for him, two hands to work for him, two feet to travaile for him: Now (ſaith he) had a man but that skill, and cunning, to make that one head, that one tongue, thoſe two hands, and two feet, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; he would hardly be circumvented by any carnall Policy. By mutuall Affection one with another, this is done.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, very Nature calleth on us for this Reciprocallneſſe, and leanes to mutuall requitall. Doth not the Earth which receives moyſture from the skye, repay it back againe into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, and exhalations? Doth not the Rock which receives a ſound from the aire before it be fully given, returne it by an Eccho? Doth not the ſtony Wall being heated by the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames, reflect-back heat? Doth not my bed, and cloathes keep me warme all day, when I have warmed them? Are not all Creatures friendly to thoſe that do befriend them? The Lyon, the Dogg, the Storke are all returners of Love for Love. Shall I inſtance?<note place="margin">Aul.

            <p>The kindneſſe and fidelity of Doggs towards thoſe who have daily fed them, is no leſſe remarkable (if it be not troubleſome nor offenſive to any, as I hope it will not) I ſhall only relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you what we reade in the French Hiſtory: A Gentleman of <hi>France</hi> being murthered, his Dogg would not depart from the ſlaine Corps, untill by the Kings command he was by force ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; The Murtherer could not by any meanes be heard
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115539:114"/>of untill it happened, that as the King was walking and taking a view of his men, the Dogg waiting upon the King, the Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer paſſed by, whom the Dogg no ſooner perceived, but he ran furiouſly upon him, and returning again to the King looked ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in his face, as though he required Juſtice, and thus ran to and fro; barking and howling, ſo that the King and the reſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that he was the perſon that did the Murther; he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon examined, but denyed the fact; Thereupon the King was purpoſed to make tryall what the Dogg would do, he gave leave to the Gentleman to uſe his ſword for his defence, and armed the Dogg with Leather, and ſo turned them both together; the Dogg aſſaulted the Gentleman with ſuch fury and violence, that perceiving himſelf like to be torn in pieces, and unable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf from the Dogg (he deſiring to be freed from his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) confeſſed the fact. The manner of this fight was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King to be drawen in a table for a memoriall, and to be kept in the Kings Court, where it was to be ſeen many yeares after. The like diſcovery we read was made by a Dogg of the Murtherer of his Maſter, in King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his Army.</p>
            <p>Many ſtrange relations we find in good and credible Authors of Love and kindneſſe, ſhewed by bruit beaſts (in their kind) to thoſe that have been kind unto them, which might be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſhame of thoſe that are ungratefull: heare how God complaines of ungratefull <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

            <p>Who this Friend ſhould be, that in his journey comes out of the way to viſit his Friend, is queſtionable: <hi>Theophylact's</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that the <hi>Angels of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who aſſiſt us in all our wayes, are to be underſtood thereby: <hi>Bernard</hi> conceives that it is <hi>man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> who in his journey to the grave, comes out of the way, wherein he naturally is (the way of Sin and Vanity) and by true converſion viſits <hi>his own ſoul</hi> by ſad and ſerious thoughts of his ſad condition; (as did the Prodigall upon his returne to his Fathers houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.) And this his opinion is beſt liked, and moſt followed. <hi>Gualter</hi> obſerves from hence that,</p>

               <hi>Whilst we are in the body, we are in our journey,</hi> we are all of us but a brood of Travailers, during our abode on Earth. To which point I ſhall ſpeak ſomthing.</p>
            <p>In a two-fold reſpect, man in this Life, may be ſaid to be in his journey. In reſpect of his <hi>Being,</hi> and in reſpect of his <hi>Doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In reſpect of his <hi>Being,</hi> he is a Travailer, or Pilgrim, for he Travailes from the Wombe to the Grave, from the Cradle to the Coffin without Intermiſſion, whether he be by Sea or by Land, on horſe-back, or on foot, ſleeping or waking, he is upon his journey ſtill, and daily ſhortens it. As Rivers run back into the Sea from whence they came, and Bees into their Hives from whence they fly;<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> ſo duſt we are, and to that we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Indeed Rivers and Bees goe <hi>often</hi> into their journeys, man <hi>only once,</hi> and when he returnes to the Grave, he is come to his hou e, <hi>Job.</hi> 17.13. And there he is well known, and amongſt his kindred,<note place="margin">Job. 17.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Job.</hi> 17.14.</p>
            <p>And yet the Grave is not the furtheſt end of mans journey. The way of his <hi>Doing</hi> carryes him to a further home; Every Action is a ſtep, that tends to Life or Death, to Heaven or Hell;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.6. Rom. 2.7. Acts 1.25. Rom. 2.8, 9:</note> Heaven is the Godly mans home, the end of well Doing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. And Hell is the wicked mans home, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.25. and the end of wicked Doing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8, 9.</p>

            <p>Thus every one is in his journey, and upon his travaile, all the while he liveth here, he is from home, upon the way, and ſo properly a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> on Earth, he is borne out of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as no other Creature is.</p>
            <p>The ſteps or paces that the Godly take in the wayes of well-doing, are holy motions, godly reſolutions, pious actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo they proceed from ſtrength to ſtrength, till they ſee God in <hi>Sion,</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, they have <hi>wiſhed,</hi> and (after a ſort prayed) for affliction,<note place="margin">Jer. 10.24.</note> 
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24. So it is ſaid of King <hi>Alured,</hi> that he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God alwayes to ſend him ſome ſickneſſe, whereby his body might be tamed, and he the better diſpoſed and affectioned to God-ward: yet I conceive it had been better to have prayed that affliction (when it did come) might be ſanctified. For I find no direct warrant for any one abſolutely to pray for afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have not deſired the wofull day thou knoweſt, Jer.</hi> 17.16. And for that prayer of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> (before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">Jer. 17.16.</note>) <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24. he prayeth <hi>not ſimply</hi> for affliction, but by way
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115539:123"/>of <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Lord if thou wilt needs correct me, and, thy people as thou haſt threatened, then do it not in thy wrath, and fury, but in mercy and goodneſſe. For however afflictions are good to the good, yet it is but ſo <hi>accidentally;</hi> for in themſelves they are evill, and Puniſhments for ſin. Nor doth any man know his own ſtrength, how he ſhall be able to beare them.</p>
            <p>Afflictions then being thus <hi>Profitable</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> Let us not be too much affraid of them, nor complaine of them too much, as many do, though they come yawning upon us, (like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Lyon) as if they would devoure us, but let us husband them well, as we ought; let them drive us to God as the ſtorme doth the Birds to their rowes, and Beaſts to their denns, and Ships into their Havens: they are part of our portion in this Life, and may not be waſted Prodigally; And though you look on them as on ſo many wayward gueſts, yet at their going away they pay freely. To conclude (then) in a word. Let our <hi>Afflictions</hi> cauſe us to ſeek out a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> a <hi>Promiſe</hi> cauſe us to ſeek out <hi>Faith, Faith</hi> put us to ſeek out <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> will not faile to <hi>find out God.</hi>

In a word, Look as the ſoul of man is ſaid to be in the <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Heart,</hi> ſo conceive of Gods being in Heaven. The ſoul (we know) animates the whole body of man, and by the preſence of it, in every member communicates Life to the whole: yet by way of preheminency and excellency, it is ſaid to be in the <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Heart</hi> of man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in theſe two parts of man, and from thence ſhe exerciſeth her cheifeſt functions, and deriveth her cheifeſt influence. Thus it is with God, he is every where; And yet ſaid to be <hi>within in Heaven,</hi> becauſe thence is the cheifeſt rayes of his majeſty mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted. Thus God may be ſaid to be within, in reſpect of his <hi>Habitation</hi> and dwelling.</p>
            <p>More Particularly; God may be ſaid to be within, in two other reſpects: Firſt in regard of <hi>Audience;</hi> he is re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He is alwayes <hi>within,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>readineſſe to heare us when we call upon him,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 102.17.19, 20.</note> So Pſal. 102.17.19, 20. <hi>He hath regard to the prayers of the destitute,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>He looked down from the height of his Sanctuary, from Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth, to heare the groaning of the Priſoner, to looſe thoſe that are appointed to Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This readineſſe of God's to heare us may be ſeen, firſt in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Anſwer to his, <hi>as ſoone</hi> as ever they have done their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.20. when the people murmured and God threatened,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.15.

               <hi>Moſes</hi> cryed, and the Lord preſently anſwered, <hi>I have forgiven them according to thy Requeſt.</hi> So 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.7. And <hi>Acts</hi> 4.31. When they had done praying,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 22.7. Acts 4.31.</note>

            </p>

            <p>Fourthly; He ſhewes his readineſſe to heare, in that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>before we can ſpeak a word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.5.</note> when it is but in the <hi>purpoſe of our Hearts</hi> to pray, God prevents us, and grants us that which he knowes we would have begged of him.<note place="margin">Iſay. 65.24.</note>

               <hi>Father I thank thee</hi> (ſaid our Saviour at the rayſing up of <hi>Lazarus</hi>) that thou haſt heard me: <hi>Bernard</hi> notes upon theſe words, that at that time, when Chriſt gave thanks to God for having heard him, he had ſaid nothing to his Father, but in his <hi>heart.</hi> And that God had heard before he ſpake.

            <p>Fifthly and laſtly; He ſhews his readineſſe to hear us, <hi>in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a voyce in that which hath no voyce,</hi> and that is our Teares. <hi>The Lord hath heard the voyce of my weeping</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi>

            <p>And as he is alwayes within, in regard of his <hi>readineſſe to heare</hi> ſo no leſſe within in regard of his <hi>Ability to help</hi> and ſuccour us. <hi>God hath ſpoken once, yea twice have I heard it, that Power belongs unto the Lord</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 62.11.

            <p>The third Inſtance we have in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take from him the Meſſenger of Satan that buffeted him, but not ſo ſoone as he would have had it removed, <hi>Thrice</hi> he beſought God earneſtly,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.8.</note> that it might depart from him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. but God having reſpect to his greater Humiliation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs

            <p>Secondly, God doth thus delay us, to <hi>quicken our Appetites,</hi> en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>e our deſires, and make us the more earneſt and fervent in Prayer, dealing herein as the Fiſher doth in drawing back his baite, to make the fiſh more eager of it.

            <p>Thirdly, God doth this for the <hi>tryall</hi> and diſcovery of <hi>thoſe</hi> graces that are in us, and to inure us to Patience, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſubmiſſion of our wills to his.

               </gap>ough we find our ſelves diſappointed for the preſent. And ſo our Patience and other graces, by the exerciſe of which in tryalls he brings us to more perfection in them (for uſe makes perfectneſſe;) Hereto tends that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.8.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. <hi>We had the ſentence of Death in our ſelves, that we might not truſt in our ſelves, but in God, which quickeneth the dead,</hi> And thus by theſe delayes we come to be the better fitted for mercy.</p>
            <pb n="228" facs="tcp:115539:131"/>
            <p>Fourthly, hereby the <hi>mercy is better prepared for us,</hi> for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the greater, and the ſweeter; by delaying and putting off our ſuite, we are brought to value the thing ſued for the more, when things eaſily had are lightly eſteemed: lightly come, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goe,<note place="margin">

            <p>And by this meanes <hi>the mercy</hi> when it is obteyned <hi>is the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and more welcome when it comes. <hi>Iſaac</hi> is <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a Son of Laughter, when he comes after many yeares expecting.

Pſal. 31.21.</note> read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.2. with 24. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.21. All the time that God delayes the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is but conſulting (as it were) of the fitteſt opportunity, and the beſt way to Anſwer the prayers of his Servants.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we muſt learne to put a difference betwixt <hi>delayes</hi> and <hi>denyalls</hi> his forbearance is no denyall of thy ſuit, God may regard thy prayer, and anſwer it too, though he do not preſently grant that thou beggeſt of him, ſhould he deny thee having engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf by promiſe to heare,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.15.</note>

            <p>Fourthly, thou may'ſt <hi>be anſwered</hi> when thou thinkeſt that thou <hi>art delay'd</hi> and put off. God hath many times anſwered the prayers of his Children, when they perceived it not; either through <hi>heedleſſeneſſe;</hi> or negligence, not looking up after their Prayers,<note place="margin">Pſal. 85.8.

            <p>Laſtly, if God do for a time with-hold the thing thou prayeſt for, and his Anſwer likewiſe, yet thou may'ſt reſt aſſured that he doth it <hi>for thy good,</hi> for one of thoſe ends before mentioned. Which if thou findeſt to be wrought in thee, thou art an happy man.</p>
            <p>Charge not God (then) fooliſhly with harſh dealing or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe, nor make any raſh concluſion againſt thy ſelf, as if thou wert out of favour with God, but make the true Uſe of it, for although our hearts may not ſink under this burthen, yet we may not paſſe it over, as a ſlight matter, or thing of nothing, but lay it to heart as the Godly have done,<note place="margin">Pſal. 28.1.</note>

Therefore let us never be angry, and repine at that which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth from the intent of our mind, nor diſcontented with his long delayes; many Anſwers at the laſt ſhall be given thee at once. For as the wicked <hi>treaſure up wrath</hi> by their <hi>daily Sinns,</hi> ſo do the Godly <hi>mercy</hi> by their <hi>daily Prayers</hi> (ſaith one): what thou haſt been craving this ſeaven yeares, nay twenty, thou then ſhalt have a returne of; for <hi>Mercyes</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> will come thick, as they did to <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Then you ſhall receive the mony together.

            <p>Or ſuppoſe, thy Anſwers ſhould be few whil'ſt thou liveſt, concerning the things that in this Life thou craveſt, yet at the day of thy Death thou ſhalt have the benefit; Then hath <hi>the Righteous Hope,</hi> Prov. 14.32. <hi>Marke it</hi> and <hi>behold it</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 37.37.<note place="margin">Pro. 14.32.

               </label> The beſt of us all have great cauſe to be humbled for this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our hearts; when being convinced of the neceſſity of a duty to be performed by us, belonging either to our generall or particular Calling, we deferr and put it off, under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, It is not now ſeaſonable, the time is not convenient for the doing of it.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Hearing of the word</hi> is out of ſeaſon with ſome, as the Apoſtle intimates, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 2.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.2. <hi>Aug. lib. de. paſt.</hi>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115539:143"/>out of ſeaſon to thoſe who are unwilling, and judge it to be ſo.

            <p>So in the works of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> we are apt to delay and put off, under pretence the <hi>Dore is ſhut,</hi> we cannot ſpare as yet; when we dye the dore will be open, then we will give more amply and liberally: as yet our charge is great, expenſes large, and who knowes but we may want our ſelves before we dye? In ſhort, the maine buſineſſe of our Lives is neglected under this pretence. Call upon men to Repent and turne, to make their peace with God, they think that we come <hi>to torment them before their time.</hi> It is not good, ſay they, to be religious too ſoon. Old Age and Sickneſſe is fitter for ſad thoughts, than youth; Repentance muſt be deferred till a more convenient time.<note place="margin">Modò et modò ſine paululum, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> modò &amp; modò non habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt modum, Aug. conf. <hi>lib. 8.

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly; An <hi>uncertaine Good</hi> (though in its own Nature more excellent,) <hi>may not exclude a certaine good,</hi> (though of an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Nature,<note place="margin">Pro. 3.27.28.</note>) that is in our Power to do, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.27, 28.

            <p>Thus learne we to informe our Judgements, not only of <hi>what is good,</hi> and to be done by us, but alſo <hi>in what degree of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> every Chriſtian duty is; that every thing in due order may be choſen; the <hi>higheſt degree</hi> before the <hi>mean,</hi> and the <hi>mean</hi> before that which is <hi>Inferiour</hi> unto it.

               <hi>as when it ſtands open to us.</hi> The Truth of this appeares by that which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.25. and <hi>Math.</hi> 25.10, 11.</p>
            <p>For the better clearing of the point, let me ſhew you (before I come to the Uſe;) when the Dore may be ſaid to be ſhut upon us, and when to ſtand open for us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dore is ſhut,</hi> firſt when the <hi>Decree</hi> is paſt and gone forth againſt a Land, Nation, or particular Perſon,<note place="margin">Zeph. 2.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.1, 2. Gods Decrees are immutable, and unchangeable, as himſelf, and ſecret to himſelf, we cannot Dive into them;<note place="margin">Dr. Preſton <hi>on the Attrib.</hi> 1.2.4.82.</note> but there is a <hi>double Time</hi> to be taken notice of by us; Firſt, a Time of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and trying</hi> before this unchangeable Decree come forth, which to ſome is longer then to others: God bore long with the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſſe,<note place="margin">Numb. 14.22:</note> 
               <hi>ten times</hi> they provoked him before he declared his reſolution of rejecting them, before that <hi>Decree came forth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4.3.</note> before he <hi>ſware in his wrath that they ſhould not enter into his reſt.</hi> And there is a Time when the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is come forth and past:</hi> till that be come forth and paſt, there is a Dore of Hope opened, but when that is paſt, and the Dore ſhut, the Prayers that we put up, either for our ſelves, or others will not avayle, nor be ſucceſſefull. For prooſe of this, read <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Therefore pray not thou for this people,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Jer. 7.16.</note> But what if the Jewes being moved with the calamity, ſhould cry and importune the Lord with Teares, Faſting, Praying, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> If they do, (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I will not heare them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 11.11.14. &amp; 14.11, 12. &amp; 15.1.</note> 
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.11.14. &amp; 14.11, 12. But put Caſe, others of Gods beloved ones, ſome of Gods ſpeciall favorites, the worthyes of the world ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for them? Well (ſaith God) <hi>though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before me</hi> for <hi>them, verſe</hi> 15.1. or thoſe three men, <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were in ſuch a Citty, they ſhould not prevaile for that City, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14.20.<note place="margin">Ezek. 14.14.20.</note> Before that <hi>Dore of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> be ſhut, they may do much: but if the Decree be paſt, all Hope is paſt, Prayer ſpeeds not, the <hi>Dore is now ſhut.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:115539:147"/>
            <p>Secondly, the Dore is ſhut, when <hi>the meanes</hi> that ſhould do us good <hi>are taken from us,</hi> and then our ſeeking may prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſſefull, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11, 12. God threatened <hi>a Famine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 8.11, 12</note> not of bread, but <hi>of the Word</hi> which is worſe, and that time of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine mine is unſeaſonable to ſeek out for food; Then our Prayers have a moultring time, the wing of our Hope is cut ſhort, then <hi>they ſhall wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North even to the East</hi> they ſhall run to and fro, to ſeek the word of the Lord, and ſhall not find it. Whil'ſt the means of doing good are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, a <hi>large Dore is opened</hi> unto us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.9. 2 Cor. 6.2.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9. that is an <hi>acceptable Time</hi> to be heard in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. but if we omit theſe opportunityes of Grace which lye open, and faire before us, God will not only deprive us of them (through our neglect,) but make us cry mightily for them, before we do enjoy them,<note place="margin">Pro. 28.9.</note> 
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 28.9. Thoſe who in proſperity deſpiſe Gods Lawes, ſhall hardly have their Prayers heard in time of trouble.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Dore is ſhut <hi>when a man is taken from the meanes,</hi> though they be continued, yet hee is diſabled from attending on them, and that either by weakneſſe, and other infirmityes, or by Death it ſelf. When neither the parts of the Body, nor the powers of the Soul can diſcharge their office.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi> brings in old and decrepit Age; deafe, blind, lame, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded, full of coughs and aches, trembling on a ſtaffe, robbed of all its ſenſes, and preſents him to the young man to behold; willing him to <hi>Remember his Creator in the dayes of his youth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe evill dayes come upon him, and thoſe yeares draw nigh wherein he ſhall ſay, I have no pleaſure in them,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This old Age he calls an <hi>evill Time,</hi> becauſe when the dayes of youth are not well ſpent, the dayes of old Age are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to goodneſſe, exhorting that before thoſe <hi>evill dayes come,</hi> they would <hi>remember God</hi> that made them, and ſerve him, calling upon his name; for if it be deferred till thoſe evill dayes come, their ſeeking of God will not be ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>And yet to <hi>him that is living there is hope,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.4.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.4.</note> in which reſpect a <hi>living Dogg is better then a dead Lyon:</hi> for <hi>when Death comes</hi> the Dore is <hi>ſo ſhut,</hi> that no Prayers can
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115539:147"/>prevayle, no returning from the grave to praiſe God. Thence it was that <hi>David</hi> forbore any longer to <hi>Faſt and Pray</hi> for his Child,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.22.</note> hearing of the Death of it. And the wiſe man adviſeth to do whatever our hand findeth to do with all our Power, for that <hi>there is no work,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.10.12.</note> 
               <hi>nor knowledge in the grave whither we are going.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly; <hi>at the day of Judgement</hi> the Dore <hi>will</hi> be ſo ſhut, that it ſhall <hi>never be opened more,</hi> then all our prayers,<note place="margin">Luk. 13.25, 26.

            <p>Firſt, it is a kind of diſquietneſſe to <hi>keep them from their beds;</hi> albeit they are not thereof ſenſible, yet God likes it not, who as he hath made the <hi>body</hi> a <hi>houſe for the ſoul,</hi> till he calls it forth, ſo hath he made the <hi>Grave a houſe for the Body,</hi> till he calls it up, <hi>Job.</hi> 17.13. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 26.19.<note place="margin">Job. 17.13.

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Patience;</hi> This will teach a man not to offer, but rather to ſuffer wrong, and to buy peace, albeit it be with much dammage, as we read <hi>Abraham</hi> did of <hi>Lot;<note place="margin">Gen. 13.9. <hi>Ruffia.</hi>

            <p>Fourthly;<note place="margin">Rom. 12.10. Phil. 2.2. 1 Pet. 3.8.

            <p>If there be difference in judgment, yet there may be no diſtance in Affection. Still we ſhould Love as Bretheren, as did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter, Hierom</hi> and <hi>Auſtin.</hi> This will keep us from judging, and cenſuring thoſe who diſſent from us as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian prophane: Oh that we could tread in this path, but iniquity abounds, and love is grown cold. Thus you have heard of the paths of peace, and of that which makes for Peace, which muſt be followed.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt thing that muſt be done for procuring Reſt to the Church,<note place="margin">Pſal. 122.6. Pſal. 51.18. &amp; 53.6. Rom. 15.5. 2 Theſ. 3.16.</note> is <hi>Prayer, Pſal.</hi> 122.6. Thus <hi>David</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.18. and 53.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.13.

            <p>I have now only a word or two, by way of <hi>Motive</hi> to ſay unto you, I would faine ſet an edge upon what
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115539:160"/>hath been delivered, and quicken you to the Duty in ſeeking after the Reſt of Gods Church. And for this end Conſider:</p>
            <p>Firſt you have <hi>a Call</hi> to do it, and that may encourage you,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.15. Coloſ. 3.15. Heb. 13.10. 1 Cor. 14.3. Iſay. 9.6. Epheſ. 6.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.15. If you look to Particulars, you have the <hi>God of Peace for your Father, The Prince of Peace for your Governour,</hi> your <hi>Law</hi> is a <hi>Goſpel</hi> of Peace, your <hi>Titles, Titles of Peace, Sons of Peace,</hi> you are <hi>Doves,</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi> not <hi>Doggs</hi> nor <hi>Swine.</hi> No one duty more preſſed nor called oftner upon, then this of Peace, <hi>Peace, hold your Peace;</hi> hath the Parents of our bodyes often ſaid. Now then let me uſe the Apoſtles words, <hi>If there be any Conſolation in Christ,</hi> &amp;c: if there be any ſuch thing as the comfort of Love, or the fellowſhip of the ſpirit, <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill you my joy,</hi> yea your <hi>Fathers joy,</hi> your <hi>Mothers joy,</hi> your <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therens joy, that you be like minded,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider the good that followes upon the Churches Peace, <hi>Behold how good and pleaſant a thing it is,</hi> Pſal. 133.1. <hi>Pax optima rerum,</hi> It is good beyond expreſſion,<note place="margin">Pſal. 133.1.</note> every way good. <hi>Behold</hi> it,</p>
            <p>Firſt in <hi>Reference to God,</hi> ſo it is <hi>good;</hi> It makes us fitter to praiſe him, and do him ſervice with greater comfort, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, as we ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.5.</note> 
               <hi>Now the God of Patience and Conſolation grant you to be like-minded,</hi> &amp;c. why, to what end? that <hi>you may with one mind and one mouth glorifie God, even the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is <hi>Good</hi> in <hi>Reference to Chriſt the Head,</hi> whoſe comming was to eſtabliſh peace on earth, as appeares by the Angells, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. So <hi>Epheſ,</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.<note place="margin">Luke 2.14. Epheſ. 2.13, 14. Coloſ. 1.20. Rom. 5.10. John. 14.21.23.</note> Now whilſt there is diſcord, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> the work that Chriſt came to do is undone, hence is that of our Saviour in his Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17.21.23. <hi>Holy Father keep through thine own name, thoſe that thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are, that the world may beleeve that thou haſt ſent me,</hi> that is, that the world may be convinced of the efficacy of my comming, ſeeing the Concord, Vnity, and good Agreement, amongſt the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church.</p>
            <pb n="288" facs="tcp:115539:161"/>
            <p>Thirdly; it is <hi>good</hi> in <hi>Reference to the Church,</hi> for as it is in the naturall body, not only the beauty, but the ſtrength and ſafety of the whole conſiſts in the Union of the parts; ſo is it in the Body Myſticall, which like a tight ſhip makes head againſt the waves, and whilſt her ſides hold, and her planks lye cloſe, ſhe worketh it out bravely in a ſtorme; but when they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted, ſhipwrack followes. Agree amongſt your ſelves, ſaid <hi>Severus</hi> to his Soldiers, and feare nothing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is <hi>good,</hi> in <hi>reference to our ſelves,</hi> as being an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our being in the Body, and true members of the Church,<note place="margin">Iſay. 11.6. John 17.11, 22. Jer. 29.7. Pſal. 122.6. Pſal. 34.12, 13. 1 Pet. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>Iſay.</hi> 11.6. <hi>John</hi> 17.11.22. And for outward Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, our Peace depends on the Churches peace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.6. There is plenty, and proſperity attends the Churches peace, never look to ſee good dayes till you ſee the Church enjoy her Reſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.12, 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for <hi>Gods ſake,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt's ſake,</hi> for the <hi>Churches ſake,</hi> for your <hi>own ſakes,</hi> labour and endeavour after the peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>Fifthly; It is <hi>good in reſpect of thoſe without,</hi> for peace in the Church is as an Adamant, it drawes men into it. This was a prevailing Argument with the <hi>Sichemites</hi> to enterteyne <hi>Jacob, The men are peaceable,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 34.11.</note> ſaid <hi>Sichem, Gen.</hi> 34.11. So it drawes others to a Love of true Religion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if this prevaile not, then conſider the ill effects of her trouble, and diſquiet, for hereby the Church comes to be ſcandalized. One of the maine ſcandalls that the Jewes take againſt Chriſtians, is their diſſentions in Religion. And the <hi>Turke</hi> could ſay that he ſhould ſooner ſee all his fingers to be of one length, then Chriſtian Princes to be of one mind. And <hi>Camerarius</hi> tells us of one,<note place="margin">Philip. Camer. in oper. ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And one of the chiefeſt objections of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt the reformed Churches, at this day is our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions amongſt our ſelves, evident ſignes (ſay they) of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall Spirit. Nay among our ſelves, Religion ſuffers by our
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115539:161"/>diſcords, men of prophane mindes, think Religion but a fancy or a phrenſie, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.23.</note> To heare many ſpeak in the Church with <hi>strange tongues,</hi> will they not ſay <hi>you are mad,</hi> &amp;c. This cauſeth many to forſake us, keeps back others from joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us, (as was ſaid before,) cauſeth our enemyes to write, and ſpeak againſt us,<note place="margin">Pſal. 44.13.</note> ſo that we are now become a <hi>reproach to our Neighbours, a ſcorne and deriſion to thoſe who are round about us, Ought we not therefore</hi> (as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid in another caſe) <hi>to walk in the feare of God, becauſe of the reproach of our Adverſaryes:</hi> ſo,<note place="margin">Neh. 5.9.</note> ought we not to be of one mind, in reſpect of thoſe who behold ours differences, and rejoyce at them? Sirs, ſaid <hi>Bias</hi> to his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in a mutiny, <hi>your enemies ſee you;</hi> ſo, <hi>Atheiſts, Papists</hi> behold and clap their hands. I have read that there was ſomtimes a great conteſt between <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> but when they heard how the <hi>Arrians</hi> (the common enemies of Chriſt and his Church) began to take advantage thereof, to the prejudice of the Truth, they preſently laid their controverſies aſleep, and both joyned againſt the common Adverſary; ſo ſhould we, according to that foretold, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 11.13.14.<note place="margin">Iſay. 11.13, 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, yet more; It doth not only ſcandalize the Church, but it tends to the ruine, and ſubverſion of the Church, (for diſſention ever tends to deſolation, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.25.<note place="margin">Math. 12.25.</note>) Boards joyned make a ſhip, but diſ-joyned a ſhip-wrack; Connexion of ſtones makes a houſe, but the diſſipation of them a ruine. If men think to build and agree not, they are deceived. Such do with the fooliſh woman in the Proverbs,<note place="margin">Pro. 14.1.</note> pull down the houſe with their own hands; or, if they build, they build but a <hi>Babel</hi> of <hi>Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Conſider; how highly God is offended, with ſuch as diſquiet the Peace of the Church, <hi>Offences indeed will come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 28.7.</note> 
               <hi>but woe to thoſe by whom they do come. Thou hast troubled us,</hi> and <hi>God ſhall trouble thee this day,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Achan.</hi>

            <p>The next degree of Gods willing, ſtands in <hi>commanding good, approving of it,</hi> where it is found.

            <p>The higheſt degree of willing in God, is, <hi>when he ſo wills a thing,</hi> as that withall he employes his <hi>Omnipotent Power for the effecting of it,</hi> and by this he doth whatſoever he pleaſeth in the Heavens, and on the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3.<note place="margin">Pſal. 115.3.</note> This Will cannot be reſiſted: And thus he wills the ſalvation of the elect, and workes that in them that he requires of them.</p>

The effects of the Spirit, ſo farr as they concerne knowledge, and inſtruction are not particular information, for reſolution in any doubtfull Caſe (for this were plainly revelation): but as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell which was ſent to <hi>Cornelius</hi> informes him not, but ſends him to <hi>Peter</hi> to School, ſo the Spirit teacheth not, but ſtirrs in us a deſire to learne. Deſire to learne, makes us thirſt after the meanes; and pious ſedulity and carefullneſſe makes us watchfull in the choyce, and dilligent in the Uſe, of the meanes. The promiſe to the Apoſtle of the ſpirit, which ſhould <hi>lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Truth,</hi> was made good to them by private and ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of their underſtandings, with the knowledge of high and heavenly myſteryes, which as yet had never entered into the conceit of man; The ſame promiſe is made to us, but fullfilled after another manner; For what was written in their hearts by <hi>Revelation,</hi> for our inſtruction; have they written in their bookes. To us for our information otherwiſe then out of theſe bookes, the Spirit ſpeaks not. Thus far he.</p>
            <p>To conclude the Point, Remember what you read, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.13.<note place="margin">1 King. 1.13.</note> There was a great contention betwixt <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> who ſhould reigne, and there was great parts taking: Prieſts were againſt Prieſts; Captaines againſt Captaines; and mighty men againſt mighty men; <hi>Nathan</hi> in this Caſe adviſeth <hi>Bathſheba</hi> to go to <hi>David</hi> himſelf, and to know his pleaſure in the buſineſſe.

               <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.24. The one had a free and willing ſpirit; the other not: and that enkindled the ſpirit of the one, which quenched the other.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Example we have in <hi>David,</hi> going to fight <hi>Goliah:</hi> Could a man have more diſcouragements then he had? partly from his Brethren, and then from <hi>Saul,</hi> and then from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of his Adverſary,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.28.

            <p>In the New Teſtament we read, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.4. of a <hi>Palſie</hi> man that was brought to Jeſus to be healed: but the Text ſayes, that there was no coming to the <hi>door of the houſe,</hi> where Jeſus was, by reaſon of the preſs of people: What do they in this caſe?

            <p>Secondly, Although thou canſt ſometimes ſay, the good thou wouldſt do, thou doſt not; and Oh! that I could do otherwiſe, I would do better then I do; yet thou muſt know, that thy would is of a differing Nature from that of St. <hi>Paul's;</hi> for,</p>
            <p>Firſt, St. <hi>Paul's</hi> would, was the would of a <hi>converted man,</hi> of the Regenerated part; and ſo proper onely, to a Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Perſon; to a Converted ſoul.

               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:115539:181"/>Or, it is the would, of a Naturall Conſcience at beſt, not of a Regenerated ſpirit, and Conſcience is ever on Gods ſide; none ſo wicked, but hath ſomething in Conſcience to take Gods part, as <hi>Ieſabels</hi> Evnuch was on <hi>Iehu's,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 5.</note> 2 King. 5.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there was ſome <hi>performance</hi> in his Would: he did not onely <hi>will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> but did <hi>do;</hi> doing was joyned with it, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. But yours is a <hi>Lazy-would;</hi> a willing without any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: an imperfect weak woulding, or a doing to no purpoſe. St. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth of himſelf, that he was willing <hi>in all things to live honeſtly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.18. Acts 24.16.</note> Heb. 13.18. and endeavours it, as appears, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. Is this endeavour in you? you ſay, you would be ſaved; you would leave your ſins; you would do well; but where are your endeavours? This is the wiſhing, and the woulding of the <hi>Sluggard</hi> whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes,<note place="margin">Prov. 21.25.</note> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.25. The Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard lyes on his bed, and ſaith, Oh! that I could ariſe, Oh! that I had wealth! Oh! that I had as much as my Neighbours! but he will not get out of his bed, but <hi>turns himſelf</hi> as the <hi>door on the hindges,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 26.25.</note> Prov. 26.25. he will not up to work. Such a Sluggard was <hi>Balaam, Oh! that I might dye the death of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> but he would not take paines to live their life,<note place="margin">Numb. 23.10. John 6.3 4, 35, 36. Luke 23.20. <hi>Verſe</hi> 24. Prov. 13.4.</note> 
               <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.10. So thoſe in the Goſpel, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.34, 35, 36. they would fain have the Heavenly bread; but they would not take paines for it, and come to Chriſt by faith, that they might attain it. <hi>Pilate</hi> was willing to ſave Chriſt, and releaſe him, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.20. but he did not what was in his power to do, he gave ſentence againſt him, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. Such a willingneſſe, <hi>ſlayes the ſoul,</hi> it brings nought, but deſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.4. Is there not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the would of a reſolute Soldier, and a Coward? the Coward wiſheth victory, that he may devide the ſpoil, and feed himſelf with the fatneſſe of a good booty, but he is loath to enter the battail, venture his limbs look the Enemy in the face; when a reſolute Soldier, that wiſheth Victory, will fight for it, and venture limb and life, for the obtaining of it. No further is thy will right, then it puts thee upon the means to obtain the thing willed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The would of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>vehement,</hi> as he ſpeakes of Deſires,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.12. Rom. 7.24.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.12. which appears by that Complaint of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. And ſuch are the Wouldings of every
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:115539:181"/>Regenerated ſoul, they are the pantings, and yernings of the ſoul. <hi>David</hi> compares them to the <hi>pantings of the Hart, after the water brooks,</hi> Pſal. 42.1. Which when it is ſtung,<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.1.</note> (ſay ſome) with a Serpent it is inſatiably thirſty; or, being hunted, it thirſts for water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> would: a panting would,<note place="margin">Gen. 30.1. Judg. 15.18. Pſal. 119.20.</note> a thirſting would, like <hi>Rachels</hi> deſire of Children, <hi>give me Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or I dye,</hi> like <hi>Siſeraes</hi> thirſt, I dye for it, <hi>Give me drink.

But thy would is onely a <hi>luskiſh</hi> and a yawning would; no ſtreining, no ſervency in thy wiſhes and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: they are at beſt but lukewarm; therefore naught.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, St. <hi>Pauls would,</hi> lay next his <hi>heart:</hi> no luſt came between, ſo as to ſay, I would do well, but yet ſuch a luſt muſt be ſpared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So ſaith <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.10.</note> 
               <hi>with my whole heart have I ſought thee,</hi> &amp;c. But the would of a Carnall Liver, lyes uppermoſt: it is as the froath in the glaſſe, or skim on the pot.</p>
            <p>Envy, Pride, Luſt, lyes next his heart; theſe things he would, rather then grace; his would proceeds from by-ends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Without this will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſſe, we can have no Comfort, that we are God's: all his Soldiers are Voluntaries, and not preſſed to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, No <hi>ſervice</hi> will be <hi>accepted,</hi> but what comes from a willing mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. Our ſervice muſt be <hi>reaſonable;</hi>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:115539:182"/>Unwilling ſervice the unreaſonable Creatures give, yea the Devils. Willingneſſe, is the <hi>fat of the Sacrifice;</hi> without that, it is but lean and dry.

God hath more honour by the obedience of the will,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.17.</note> then of the outward man. Humane reſtraints may rule the one, but nothing but grace can rule the other: Hereby we acknowledge God, to be the ſearcher of the heart; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of our thoughts; and Judge of our Conſciences: thence is that ſtrange ſpeech of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.10.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. <hi>You have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, not onely to do but to be willing,</hi> as if it were more, to <hi>will</hi> then to <hi>do;</hi> and ſo it is, more then to do any thing of neceſſity, with an ill will or by-reſpects whatſoever: therefore what you do, ſee you do it willingly,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.23.</note> and heartily, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.23. It addeth much to the grace of Performance; as fruit that falls willingly is well coloured, and better taſted, then that which is cudgelld down. Chriſt will enjoy his Spouſe's Love by a willing Contract; not by a Raviſhment.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A good will <hi>ſupplyeth many defects</hi> in our Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. Hence it is that we find ſometimes <hi>the will</hi> to be accepted <hi>without the work,</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, A willing mind <hi>makes</hi> quick <hi>riddance</hi> of the work we go about; <hi>it is winged,</hi> and overflyes rubbs and lets in our way: it is ſo farr from being hindered thereby, as that it is quickened, as the Bowle going down a Hill is by the rubbs it meets withall, as before hath bin ſhewed in <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua.</hi>

There was a difference betwixt them in the behalf of the Poor, (for whom the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch pleaded very ſtrongly): many hours were ſpent to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for <hi>Nicetas</hi> would not yield, although ſtrongly importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned by that good Patriarch: the day now growing towards an end, they parted diſpleaſed, each with other.

Good men, (true friends) may be in an errour, but they will be willing to ſee it, and, upon the ſight thereof, to amend it, and then they will ſay, as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abigail,</hi> when he was met by her,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.32.</note> and diſſwaded from his purpoſe, (and ſo awakened) <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord that ſent thee, and bleſſed be thy Counſel, and bleſſed be thou that haſt kept me from blood,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.32.

               <hi>God is never ſo in Bed, but being awakened by faithful Prayer, he will riſe and relieve his friends:</hi> that is the Point we are now to ſpeak unto.</p>
            <p>God is pleaſed ſometimes to put himſelf into a poſture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his friends, as if he were a man a bed, and aſleep in his bed, (as you have heard before): he ſeems to be to them as a man aſleep is to his friend, unmindful, and forgetful of them, when he retires himſelf, and doth not appear in the behalf of his ſervants: it carryeth with it ſome ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Diſciples being terrified, and much afraid, thinking their caſe deſperate, come to him, and awake him with an Out-cry, <hi>Maſter, ſave us, we periſh.</hi> Chriſt thus awaked, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends them for their immoderate fear, and the weakneſs of their Faith; <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little Faith?</hi> and then rebukes the Wind and Sea, charging them even with threatning and menaces to be ſtill; upon which followed a great calm, to the admiration of all beholders.</p>
            <p>Beſides the truth of the ſtory, there is a myſtery in that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Scripture (by the conſent of all Divines, Antient and Modern) it ſets forth unto us, the ſtate of the <hi>Church</hi> of God, militant on Earth, reſembled unto a <hi>Ship,</hi> wherein Chriſt and all the Faithful do paſs from Earth to Heaven. The <hi>Sea</hi> is the <hi>World,</hi> a very unconſtant Element, reſembled by St. <hi>John</hi> to a Sea of Glaſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.6. The great <hi>ſtorm and tempeſt</hi> that ariſeth, is a lively Repreſentation of the great <hi>troubles and perſecutions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1.16.</note> which are raiſed by the Devil and his Inſtruments againſt the Church, intending the ruine of it: <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his being <hi>aſleep</hi> in this ſtorm, ſets forth the <hi>ſeeming neglect</hi> that he hath of the peace &amp; quiet of the Church, for the greater manifeſtation of his power, and our patience. The <hi>crying out</hi> of the Diſciples, ſets forth the <hi>Prayers of the Faithful,</hi> who night &amp; day cry unto him, for the defence of the Church. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>ariſing</hi> &amp; <hi>rebuking</hi> of the winds, intimates his <hi>reproving,</hi> and <hi>plaguing</hi> of the <hi>enemies of the Church.</hi> The great <hi>Calm</hi> that follows, ſignifies the <hi>peace that the Church and People</hi> of God ſhall enjoy in the end, in deſpight of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:115539:188"/>Sathan, and all his adhaerents. And thus much for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Point propounded: The Uſe followes.</p>

Great are the miſeries that the poor Church of Chriſt hath groaned under for divers years; he is graceleſſe, ſenſeleſſe, that is not ſenſible thereof: the ſtormes that we have met withall have bin more then ordinary, great tempeſts we have bin in, and yet are not over; the Ship is yet full of water, which cauſeth the hearts of experienced Fiſhermen, (ſuch as <hi>Peter</hi> was,) who having bin uſed to ſee ſtorms, to cry out, <hi>they periſh:</hi> All this while our Pilot is in the ſtern, ſleeping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a pillow; which cauſeth us to think hardly of him, and to charge him with unkindneſſe, as if he cared not for us whether we ſink, or ſwimm: Now what ſhall we do in this Caſe? Let us with the Diſciples run to God, by Prayer, and awake him; they did it very turbulently, &amp; irreverently, (as it ſeems, for their fear was great) yet Chriſt blamed them not for that, but for their too much fear, and too little faith. Come then to the Throne of Grace, deſire God to awake and ariſe, he is willing to be awaked by us, and therefore ſeems to ſleep, that we may awake him: God admitts his ſervants to this boldneſſe with him. Princes like it not. Should a ſubject come to the Supreame, and ſay, Would your Highneſſe, or your Majeſty, would awake once, and ariſe to do ſuch, or ſuch a buſineſſe for me, or read
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:115539:189"/>my Petition: would not the Prince conceive juſt indignation againſt ſuch a Petition: yet God is well pleaſed that we ſhould thus come unto him, and ſay, <hi>Awake Lord, come and help us:</hi> If we thus come, He will awak; nothing ſooner awakes a ſeeming ſleepy God, then Prayer, (as you have heard): were our God a dead God, an Idol God, prayer could not do it, (as we ſee in the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi>) but of our God, we may ſay as Chriſt of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he is not dead, but ſleepeth onely and that ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

Thus the <hi>vile perſon</hi> will ſeemingly <hi>be liberal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo the <hi>Churle bountiful.</hi> You have an example of this in <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.3. Churliſh enough he was to <hi>David;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.3. Verſ. 36.</note> as appears by his Anſwer to his Servants, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. His Feaſt <hi>was like the Feaſt of a King, ver.</hi> 36.

            <p>I might produce divers inſtances, for the further confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the point delivered; I ſhall trouble you but with one more, which ſhall be in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> You read of a large and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Offer, that the Devil made to Chriſt, of all the Kingdoms of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:115539:193"/>the Earth: the glory whereof he preſented unto him in a trice, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.8, 9. But can you think that it was done with a friendly mind?<note place="margin">Math. 4.8, 9.</note> No ſuch thing; for it was a wicked and Diabolical Liberality: as appears,</p>
            <p>Firſt, in that he was liberal, <hi>of what was not his own:</hi> He ſaid, indeed,<note place="margin">Luke 4.6, 7.</note> that all was his to diſpoſe of at his pleaſure; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was a Lyar. Let Sathan ſhew his Patent, with Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes atteſting the ſame, when, where, and upon what conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God paſſed over his Power and Right to him. Had the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil had the World at his diſpoſe, <hi>juſt Job</hi> ſhould never have had Wealth, nor <hi>chaſte Joſeph</hi> Honour, &amp;c. Nor would he have begged leave to enter into the Herd of Swine. The Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof, ſaith <hi>David:</hi> In making this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Offer,<note place="margin">Pſal. 24.1.</note> he ſhewed himſelf a notorious Thief and Impoſtor: he would have robbed all other Kings of their Royalties, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt another in them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they were his <hi>own ends that he aimed at</hi> therein, and his own glory that he ſought; and, in ſeeking of himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, his Bounty was not friendly. Chriſt muſt do him homage, <hi>Worſhip me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, his Bounty <hi>tended to the diſhonour of God,</hi> and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſinne, and to entice to Idolatry; which God abhors. Chriſt muſt <hi>fall down,</hi> and worſhip him: it muſt be performed with all Solemnity and ſtate, after the beſt manner and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, his Bounty and Liberality <hi>was not free,</hi> but <hi>Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:</hi> If thou wilt do this, ſaid he to Chriſt; and to make ſure work, he would have all paid him before hand, Chriſt muſt do the work, before he would part with any thing.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, his Bounty proceeded out of a deſire <hi>to ſatisfie his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient envie,</hi> in the deſtruction of all mankind, and ſo he was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous to his Offers:<note place="margin">Math. 16.26.</note> he would have got more then he gave, (for one Soul is more worth then the World, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.26.) Then what were the Souls of all men; all which had been loſt, had Chriſt conſented to that which the Devil required. And thus you have heard the Point proved. Now let us apply it.</p>

So Church-Lands have been taken from <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and given to <hi>Rapiſts,</hi> to maintain Hounds and Harlots. How many great men of the World have by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and extortion made a thouſand Beggars, and then at the day of their Death, bequeſted a thouſand pounds, or two, to build an Hoſpital to maintain ten? We read of <hi>Cain,</hi> that he firſt ſacrificed, and then ſlew his Brother; but ſuch, as in their prophane bequeaſts, give of that they have extorted from others, firſt ſlay their Brethren, and then offer a part of their ill-gotten goods for ſacrifice. Theſe are worſe then <hi>Cain,</hi> in that reſpect. Shall we eſteem theſe liberal, who build Hoſpitals for Children with their Fathers bones? So were the Jews, who bought a burying place for ſtrangers with the bloud of Chriſt. Our <hi>Daniel,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> relates, that when <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d, had ſent a Load of Freez to the Fryar-Minors, to cloath them; they ſent it back again, with this meſſage, That he ought not to give Alms of that which he had rent from the Poor; neither would they accept of that abominable gift: and can we imagine then that God will?</p>
            <p>Some are liberal; but it is to thoſe onely that can re-pay them, or do re-pay them. Theſe play at a game of Tennis, toſs the ball to thoſe onely, that will toſs it to them again.</p>
            <p>Others are liberal, but it is for baſe ends, to procure reſpect and credit from others, (which they are ambitious of) they ſeek themſelves in their Liberality (as in large Expences on coſtly
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:115539:194"/>Buildings, gorgeous Garments). Thus <hi>Titus Veſpatianus</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how his Father was branded for his inſatiable Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſteered a contrary courſe; and by his great Bounty and Liberality was ſirnamed, <hi>Delitiae humani generis.</hi> So <hi>Abſalom</hi> made a liberal Feaſt, and, by his Bounty and Courteſie, ſtole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the hearts of the People.

            <p>Or elſe their Liberality tends to ſinne, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.16. as to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Magiſtrates.

            <p>Beſides this Parable, of a Friend coming to his Friend at Midnight, Chriſt hath given us another, that of the unjuſt Judge, who heard the Widows Cauſe, in regard of her Importunity; and not otherwiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. and withall, leaves us a Hiſtory of his own, of the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who overcame him, in the behalf of her Daughter, by importunity, (with which Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory we have before acquainted you) ſuch have the Prayers of the godly been.</p>
            <p>For the further clearing of the Point, let me ſhew you what this <hi>Inſtancie,</hi> and <hi>Importunacie,</hi> in Prayer, is, and wherein it conſiſts. And ſo</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Importunate Prayer is a fervent and frequent deſire of the Soul, for ſome ſpecial mercy; ſo as it will take no denial:</hi> Or, <hi>A fervent
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:115539:196"/>and frequent pouring forth our ſouls to God, without giving over till he grant us our deſires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three things in Importunity: Firſt, <hi>Fervency:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly <hi>Frequency:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Perſeverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Fervency:</hi> This conſiſts not in the loudneſs of the voyce (albeit, it be many times expreſſed by loud crying); the <hi>Peacock</hi> hath a louder voyce, then the <hi>Nightingale.</hi> Nor in long praying; for God doth not meaſure prayer by <hi>the length,</hi> (albeit, long Prayers, may be fervent Prayers) but in <hi>the crying</hi> of the Heart. The earneſt intention, and contention of the Soul and Spirit expreſſed in Scripture,<note place="margin">Joel 2.3.</note> by <hi>renting of the heart,</hi> and <hi>pouring out the Soul,</hi> and <hi>crying of the whole heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.145, 146. This is added as a <hi>Proviſo</hi> to effectual Prayer,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.15. Pſal. 119.145.146. Jam. 5.16. Ver. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. where <hi>effectual</hi> and <hi>fervent</hi> are joyned together: the more <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencie,</hi> the more <hi>prevalencie</hi> in our Prayer. <hi>Eliahs</hi> example is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>He prayed, and prayed,</hi> (ſo it is in the Original) We tranſlate it, <hi>He prayed earneſtly,</hi> and he was heard. Thus our Saviour prayed in the days of his fleſh,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. We read of a <hi>Dutch Martyr</hi> in our own Monuments, one <hi>Giles</hi> of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> who was ſo ardent in his Prayer, kneeling by himſelf in ſome ſecret place of the Priſon where he was, that he ſeemed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himſelf; and being called to his meat, he neither heard, nor ſaw, who ſtood by him, till he was lifted up by the arms, and then he would ſpeak gently to them, as one awaked out of a Trance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there muſt be <hi>Frequency</hi> in it: We give not over at the firſt denial; no, nor at the ſecond, if we be importunate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>One thing I have deſired of the Lord and I will ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 27.4. Pſal. 69.3. Iſa. 62.9. Ver. 6, 7.</note> that is, I have ſought it, and will ſeek again, and again: So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.3. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.1. <hi>For Sions ſake, I will not hold my tongue</hi> &amp;c. He would renew his Suit, and follow it: and the like he requires of all faithful Watch-men, that they <hi>cry day and night,</hi> and not keep ſilence, till they had obtained their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for <hi>Sion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> ver. 6, 7. Thus, <hi>Paul prayed thrice:</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> plyed the Throne of Grace, with, <hi>Once again, Lord, once again, restore the Goſpel to England:</hi> as if he would have no nay.</p>
            <pb n="359" facs="tcp:115539:196"/>
            <p>Thirdly, as our Suit is to be renewed,<note place="margin">Gen. 32.24.</note> ſo we muſt perſevere in it. So <hi>Jacob</hi> did not onely wraſtle, but <hi>continued all night</hi> and morning too: He gave not over, till he had what he ſought for: this is injoyned, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.27. And that Parable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for that very end, that we ſhould pray, and not faint,<note place="margin">Col. 4.2. 1 Theſſ. 5.27. Luke 18.1.</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1. And thus you ſee, what importunate Prayer is, and wherein it ſtands. Theſe Particulars, we ſhall hereafter, in the verſes following, ſpeak more fully unto: let us now make ſome uſe of this.</p>
            <p>

            <p>True Prayer, is not the labour of the Lips,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.16.</note> but the labour of the Heart, and of the Soul: <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed earneſtly to God, and yet not a word that we hear him ſpeak, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Wherefore cryeſt thou unto me?</hi> ſaith God; that is, with inward groanings,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.15.</note> albeit there was no audible voyce, and God heard that ſtrait.

            <p>
               <hi>Paul,</hi> before his Converſion, prayed often, and long too, for he was was a Phariſee, and one of the ſtricteſt and devouteſt of all the Sect, (as he teſtifies of himſelf) and they were given to much praying, as the Scripture teſtifies of them: yet God took no notice of all his formal and hypocritical Prayers; he gave no ear unto them before his Converſion; but when he came to be humbled, and poured forth his Soul earneſtly and fervently, God then ſaid of him, <hi>Behold he prayeth,</hi> Act. 9.11. Before he <hi>prated prayers,</hi> now he <hi>prayeth prayers:</hi> that was prayer, indeed,<note place="margin">Act. 9.11.</note> which he now put up to God: and that God heard. How often do we pray, and yet forget that we have prayed? Can we think that God will hear us, when we hear not our ſelves? Or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Prayer which we have forgotten, that we ever put up unto him.</p>
            <pb n="360" facs="tcp:115539:197"/>
            <p>Never think to be heard of God in mercy, or to obtain any bleſſing at the hands of God, by thy cold, careleſs, and cuſtomary prayer.<note place="margin">Pſal. 141.2.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> compares his prayers to <hi>Incenſe,</hi> and no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe was offered without fire: it was that, that made the ſmoak of it to aſcend: Prayer that is cold, makes but a ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and troubles the eyes of God;<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.15.</note> as he ſhews, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. but they are not a ſweet Perfume in his Noſtrils.</p>

Prayer is the <hi>Arrow of Deliverance;</hi> if it be not drawn up to the Head, is will hardly fly home unto the Mark.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour tells us of a King, that (going with Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to make Warre with another that comes againſt him with Twenty Thouſand) ſends an Ambaſſadour,<note place="margin">Luke 14.31, 32.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires Conditions of Peace, whileſt his Adverſary is yet a great way off. Our <hi>Prayers</hi> are our <hi>Ambaſſadours</hi> to God in all our fears and dangers; we ſend them to make our Peace: and as they act our Cauſe, we are ſure to ſpeed. Now it is not by their <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and <hi>Oratory,</hi> that they prevail with God; but by their <hi>earneſtneſſe</hi> and <hi>fervencie:</hi> They muſt go to work, as thoſe Ambaſſadours we read of,<note place="margin">Iſa. 33.7</note> 
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.7. They muſt <hi>cry without, and weep bitterly,</hi> and then our Peace will be made: So <hi>Luther,</hi> when he had been earneſt at his Prayers, came lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of his Cloſet, crying out to his Fellows, <hi>Vicimus, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus;</hi> and at the ſame time, the States of <hi>Germany,</hi> (after long debate) concluded for the truth of the Goſpel, yet unknown to <hi>Luther.</hi> He was wont to term Prayers, <hi>Chriſtianorum Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barda,</hi> the Gun or Canon of Chriſtians. But it is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that chargeth this Canon, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.6. It is not by our might, or by our power, <hi>but my Spirit,</hi> ſaith God.

               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And then Prayer being thus charged, God (out of a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be prevailed withall) puts himſelf into the way of a

               </label> Our Prayers are to be earneſt, as well for ſmall things, as for great: for things Temporal, as well as for things Eternal: but yet not with the like degree of earneſtneſs. The Incenſe muſt ſmoak, and the Pot boyl: this cannot be without fire; yet we make not the like fire to roſt an Egg, as to roſt an Ox.</p>
            <p>Some things that we ſtand in need of, are more excellent &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, being proper and peculiar to the Elect, which God hath
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:115539:198"/>abſolutely promiſed: about theſe we are to wreſtle,<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.1, 2. Rom. 15.30.</note> and ſtrive with God, and take no denial from him. Other things are more common and tranſitory, being but mean and worthleſs, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the other, ſcarce worth the naming: concerning which, God is not well pleaſed, that we ſhould ſpend the heat of our zeal. It is worthy of your notice, that our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in that Platform of Prayer which he hath given us, puts <hi>daily bread,</hi> before <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins:</hi> not for that it is to be preferred, but for that it may ſooner be diſpatched, and more time ſpent about the other, which concerns the Salvation of our Souls (there being two Petitions of this nature, for one of the other): for as it is in powring out of ſome Liquors, that which is thinneſt, will firſt come forth, and the thickeſt laſt; ſo is it oftentimes in pouring forth the Soul to God. And thence it is, that the Faithful are uſually more earneſt and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with the Lord, towards the end of their prayers (as it was with <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>David</hi>): This we often find.</p>
            <p>Secondly, albeit our earneſtneſs is not to be alike in degree, for ſmall things, as for great; yet our Faith muſt be the ſame, let the thing be what it will be, that we pray for, if lawfull. Small or Great, Temporal or Eternal, (if according to God's Will) we are to reſt aſſured, that it ſhall be granted with the like degree of Faith, ſeeing the truth of God's promiſe, upon which our Faith reſts, is the ſame in all things, as well ſmall as great, and always infallible. In things that God hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto us, yet not forbidden to be asked, <hi>an act of Recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bencie</hi> is ſufficient; but in ſuch things as God hath promiſed to give, and ſo far as he hath promiſed to give, be it ſmall or great, an <hi>Act of Affiance</hi> is required.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Drexellius</hi> tells us of a Viſion that a Religious man had at his Prayers in the Congregation. He ſaw a ſeveral Angel at the Elbow of every one preſent, ready to write down his Petitions: thoſe who prayed heartily, their Angels wrote down their Suits in Gold: Thoſe that prayed but coldly and careleſly, their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels wrote too, but it was with Water: Thoſe that prayed cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, onely from the teeth outward, had their Angels by them, who ſeemed to write, but it was with a dry Pen, no Ink in it: Such as ſlept had their Angels by them, but they laid their Pens by: Such as had Worldly Thoughts, their Angels wrote in the Duſt: And ſuch as had envious and malicious Spirits, their Angels wrote with Gall. If this be ſo, I fear few An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels have wrote this day in Golden Letter; but the Pens of the others have gone very faſt. Have a care how thou prayeſt, if thou wouldeſt have them written with the <hi>Golden Pen.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The grounds or Reaſons of this Doctrine delivered, are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Prayer is a <hi>moral precept,</hi> and all the Commandements of the morall Law, binde the conſciences of all men, to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſo long as they are in force; and his morall precepts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perpetuall binde the conſciences of all to obedience perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, Nor is there any one amongſt us, but <hi>ſtands in need of ſome bleſſing</hi> or other; and if we want, then muſt we pray for it (as you find in my Text).</p>
            <p>Fourthly, None but <hi>hold ſomething of God,</hi> and muſt pay this Rent; we hold by Coppy what we have, and owe to this Lord <hi>ſuite</hi> and <hi>ſervice.</hi>

               </label> But if all are bound to pray then the wicked as well as good; <note place="margin">Eſay 1.15. Pſal. 50.16. Prov. 15.8. <hi>Reſp.</hi> Acts 8.22.</note> and if ſo, why are they forbidden, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8.</p>
            <p>There is no man, ſo wicked, but ſtands Charged with this Duty, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.22. <hi>Simon Peter</hi> calls to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to pray to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Commandement enjoyns the <hi>materiall</hi> part, and impoſeth the Duty on all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Yet wicked men living in ſin may not pray, for that they ſin in the <hi>formall part</hi> of prayer, in the right manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and ſo take <hi>Gods</hi> name in vain in the performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (which is forbidden in the third Commandement). Theſe praying amiſſe without Faith, Repentance, Fear, Fervency, <hi>&amp;c. God</hi> counts their prayers abominable; and rejects them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Though wicked men ſin, if they pray not, and ſin if they pray; yet the ſin of ſuch is leſſe, who faile in the manner of praying, then theirs who wholly omitt it: for in the totall
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:115539:202"/>omiſſion of this Duty, there is a double a breach; breach both of the ſecond and third Commandements; but in performance of the duty, (though ſinfully) the third Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is onely violated.</p>

Yet ſuch may be encouraged to the Duty,<note place="margin">John 9.13.</note> as they are <hi>Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> (though but <hi>Ravens</hi>) nor will <hi>God</hi> withhold from them Common mercies, but reward, with Temporall bleſſings, the very ſhaddow of goodneſſe, as he did <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.29.</p>

            <pb n="372" facs="tcp:115539:203"/>
            <p>I might reprove the horrible prophanneſſe of moſt families; who are without prayer, and live in an ordinary neglect of this Duty: Let ſuch read thoſe Texts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.6. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30.

If this take not, but that we will needs betake our ſelves to prayer, then he will be interrupting of us, by his ſuggeſtions,

               </note> As when <hi>Alexander</hi> met with <hi>Porus,</hi> and ſaw his mighty Elephants and Army, he told his friends, that now he had found a people equal to his heart, on whom to try his valour: So ſhould a Chriſtian ſay, Now I have
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:115539:206"/>met with a Duty, that will try my beſt abilities, and ſo ſet upon it with the more courage, and reſolution of ſpirit, and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now becauſe ſome have a better inclination to perform it, then power to do it, let me give you ſome general Directions, wch being obſerved, may facilitate the work, proceeding therein in good order: A Truſs well packt together, is the better born (as you know). We read of the Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> that they would build <hi>a Tower to reach up to Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. This was their folly; but, in Prayer, we erect up a Building that reacheth to the Clouds. Now, as wiſe Builders do in building, ſo let us do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>Firſt, with that wiſe Builder, which our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us of, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28. <hi>Sit down, and count your cost:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 14.28.</note> Conſider what charge you muſt be at in the doing of it; all the care, and all the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that may be, is little enough for the ſervice. Many Lets, and Hinderances, from the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, you muſt expect to meet withall (as before was ſhewed). Now unleſs thou putteſt on an unalterable Reſolution, to break through all Lets, thou ſhalt never keep a conſtant courſe in it, or keep thy ſelf from a formal and cuſtomary performance of it: Say then to thy Soul, If I will betake my ſelf to this work, then this coſt I muſt reſolve to be at: And lay it as an inviolable Law upon thy ſelf, that no Let whatever, (that is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) ſhall hinder thee from the performance of it, after thou haſt reſolved to ſet about it. Firſt, provide materials for the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Secondly, frame it orderly. Thirdly, prepare the ground, whereon to erect the Building. Fourthly, then rear up the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. Fitting matter muſt be provided for Prayer, as <hi>David</hi> did, for the Building of the Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. All materials muſt be laid in before-hand. The wiſe Preacher (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 12.10, 11. ſought to find out acceptable words; he ſpake not at adventure, what came into his mind upon the ſuddain, but prepared the general heads and parts of his Exhortation before-hand. We like not that a Preacher ſhould ſpeak to us, without premeditation and thinking. Now Preaching is God's ſpeaking unto us; Praying, is our ſpeaking unto him; And ſhall we ſpeak to him ſuddainly, and inconſiderately, when we are not willing that he ſhould ſpeak to us after that manner? Read
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:115539:207"/>
               <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Take with you words,</hi> &amp;c. Yet our words muſt not be affected, but ſuch as are plain, apt, and ſignificant.</p>
            <p>But this is the leaſt; provide <hi>matter,</hi> and words will not be altogether wanting: Did you ever know a Beggar want words, that was pinched with need?</p>
            <p>We may be furniſhed with <hi>Matter</hi> out of the Book of the Scriptures, by that which we read, or hear. If buſineſs permit, ſome part of the Word would be read daily: It is a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to Prayer, and doth furniſh us with fitting matter to commend to God: Read the Law, and out of that gather a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of ſins committed, and Duties omitted: Read the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> and out of that gather a Catalogue of <hi>Pretious Promiſes</hi> made in Chriſt, unto us, in every condition that we are, or can be in. If this be wanting, that we cannot read, then remember what you have heard the Sabbath day before. That Sabbath was ill ſpent, the Sermon weakly preached, that doth not afford ſome ſtore of Proviſion for Prayer, all the week after.</p>
            <p>And, as hearing and reading will afford <hi>Matter</hi> for Prayer, ſo <hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>Obſervation</hi> affords plenty. <hi>Meditate</hi> on what may humble thee, what may raiſe thee, what may encourage thee, to come before God. More particularly, meditate on God's greatneſs, goodneſs, power, truth, mercy, and other of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. Theſe afford great ſtore towards this Fabrick; the Houſe of Prayer, and Duty of Prayer. Then meditate on thy own ſinful corrupt nature, proneneſs to evil, backwardneſs to good, &amp;c. of your own wants and weakneſſes, and the greatneſs of the benefit you deſire, and you ſhall be furniſhed with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>And as Meditation, ſo <hi>Obſervation</hi> will furniſh you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. Obſerve the Paſſages of God's Providence towards his Church in general, you ſelves, and yours in ſpecial, and that dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hourly, in protecting, preſerving, providing for it, and you: this do, and you cannot want matter for Prayer; you ſhall be furniſhed abundantly.</p>
            <p>And then having found <hi>Materials,</hi> proceed as <hi>Builders</hi> uſe to do. The Carpenter (ſaith one) being to build an houſe, hews not his Timber at an adventure; but before-hand, projects in his mind the ſeveral Rooms and Parts, and accordingly diſpoſeth
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:115539:207"/>of his Timber. He lays this by for Groundfil; that, for Spars; that, for Windows; that, for Studs, &amp;c. and fits every piece for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, according to the <hi>Idea</hi> and Platform conceived.

            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Head of Thanksgiving,</hi> refer all mercies received from God, either <hi>privative,</hi> or <hi>poſitive</hi> for this life, or a better; For <hi>Body, Soul, Name, Eſtate,</hi> beſtowed on our ſelves, or ours.

            <p>A third thing that Builders do, is to rid the ground of Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh, and make it fit, before they ſet up their Frame: Such a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance muſt we make, before we enter upon the Duty.

            <p>Some thoughts of Worldly things are allowable in Prayer, to the end, that we may pray for direction, and good ſucceſſe therein; elſe why did Chriſt teach us to pray for <hi>Daily Bread?</hi> But when we think on theſe things, our Thoughts may not be Worldly, through Diſtempers and Diſtractions about the ſame. <hi>Abide you here,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Abraham,</hi> to his Servants) <hi>with the Aſſe,</hi>

               </label> It is true that we are all naturally borne Idolaters, and are
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:115539:209"/>very prone to faſhion God to ſome forme of our own; and this proneſſe diſcovers it ſelf in the very beſt, and in no duty more then in prayer, but this want ſhall be covered by Chriſts interceſſion, and our ſuites followed in Heaven by his advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1.<note place="margin">1 John 2.1.</note> But for your further direction and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Caſe, know,</p>

               </gap>h moſt facility and attention. The worſt prayers that we make (to our own ſenſe,) ſpeed often beſt; and then we pray moſt happily, when we ariſe moſt humbled. Thoſe prayers that we performe with mighty conflicts, and oppoſitions are the moſt acceptable prayer. God who puts <hi>all our Teares into his bottle,</hi> all our ſighs into his boſome, all our words into his Regiſter, will alſo ſpread that ſincerity, that zeale, with which thou entered'ſt into thy prayers, over thy whole prayers: and where thy zeale is too ſhort, Chriſt will ſpread his prayers over thine, and ſay, Give him Father that which he hath faithfully deſired <hi>in my name;</hi> and where he hath fayled through wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and negligences, there Father <hi>forgive him</hi> though he hears not what he ſaid: Only be carefull to prevent theſe wanderings what may be.</p>

            <p>Secondly, <hi>Keep your thoughts within compaſſe</hi> at other times, ſuffer them not to roave about without check; if they have got a cuſtome of ranging, they will not readily be called home when you would have them. <hi>The wiſe mans heart is at his right hand,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>);<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.2.</note> he hath it not to ſeek when he ſhould uſe it about holy dudyes as the Fool hath.

               </note> The beſt way (ſaith one) to be rid of bad thoughts in thy prayers, is, not to entertain them out of thy prayers; if at other times thou entertayneſt them willingly, they will be entertavned in thy prayers againſt thy will.</p>

               <hi>True Prayer muſt be accompanyed with a ſenſe of the want of thoſe things we crave.</hi> When we come to God by Prayer, a ſenſe of thoſe things we aske, muſt be brought with us.

            </p>
            <p>In the ſenſe of want, have Gods Servants come before him continually. So <hi>Jehoſophat, We know not what to do,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 20.12. 1 Sam. 1.6.15. Pſal. 60.11. Luk. 15, 16, 17. Math. 9.12.</note> 2 Chron. 20.12. So <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.6.15. So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 60.11. So the <hi>Prodigall</hi> Luke 15.17. So all the Godly from time to time.</p>
            <p>This is that that puts us in a praying condition; for firſt, no man will aske that which he ſuppoſeth he hath no need of <hi>Math.</hi> 9.12. the proud <hi>Phariſes</hi> begged nothing, though he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thankfullneſſe, for he had no ſenſe of the want of any
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:115539:213"/>thing,<note place="margin">Luke 18.11. Revel. 3.17. Gen. 4.26.</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. So the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Revel. 3.17. <hi>Seth</hi> called his Son <hi>Enoſh</hi> that is <hi>miſerable</hi> or <hi>calamitous,</hi> Gen. 4.26. And <hi>then men began to call upon God.</hi> Felt-miſery, makes men to be religious.</p>
            <p>Secondly; This is that that humbles us, and cauſeth us to be lowly in our own eyes; It is the having of ſome good that puff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, not the want of it. The <hi>Publican</hi> being ſenſible of his wants fell proſtrate on the ground,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.13. Jam. 4.6.</note> and to be humbled thus, is neceſſary to the offering up of an acceptable prayer, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, without a ſenſe of the want of what we aske, we ſhall never earneſtly deſire it, nor uſe the meanes for the obteyning of it. It is want that makes us to ſeek out, as it did that man we heard of before, who went to his Friend at Mid-night. Now you have heard, It is importunate prayer that is prevayling.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, ſhould we have what we crave, yet without ſenſe of want of the mercy, we ſhould never prize it. <hi>Alexander</hi> was wont to ſay that his <hi>hungry dinner was his ſuppers ſawce.</hi> Unleſſe a man bring this ſawce with him, mercy would be no mercy, Chriſt no Chriſt, Heaven no Heaven: but this want makes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bleſſings ſweet; as <hi>Darius</hi> ſaid of the puddle water he drank in his flight from <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he never drank better liquor.</p>
            <p>Now there is a <hi>three-fold want</hi> that muſt be taken ſpeciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, when we come to God by Prayer.</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>of the bleſſing it ſelf,</hi> which we deſire to have be it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or inward, Corporall or Spirituall, Temporall or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; of what kind ſoever it be, we muſt be ſenſible, and have a feeling of it, and valew it accordingly; as for outward, and bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wants of health, wealth, ſtrength, and things of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; theſe are not the <hi>greateſt,</hi> and yet uſually they moſt pinch, and of them we take moſt notice, and firſt complaine: but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wants are the <hi>greater,</hi> albeit leaſt regarded, yet they pinch moſt at laſt. How many ramp like lyons when the world doth frowne upon them? but under the want of Knowledge, Faith Repentance, and other Graces of Gods Spirit, yea of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they couch as <hi>Iſſachar</hi> under his burthen, and lye down to ſleep as <hi>Jonah</hi> did in the bottome of the ſhip; but a true valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be had of our wants, and of our <hi>greatest wants</hi> ſhould we <hi>most complaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="393" facs="tcp:115539:213"/>
            <p>A ſecond want that we muſt take notice of, is <hi>our own diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to help our ſelves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm. 60.11.</note> and the diſability of any other Creature in Heaven or Earth to ſupply our wants. You have heard before, that till God be up, no Creature can ariſe to help us: <hi>David</hi> ſaw this, and found this, and proteſts againſt the expectation of help from any other Creature in Earth or Heaven,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25, 26. and being ſenſible of his own inability to help himſelf, and of the inability of any other Creature to ſupply his need, he findes his ſoul in a ſit frame, to approach before God,<note place="margin">

            </p>

               <note place="margin">Dan. 9 8, 9.</note> we muſt be ſenſible. There is as great a want of worth in the beſt of us, why God ſhould ſupply our wants, as there is of ability in our ſelves to ſupply them: <hi>I am not worthy</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi>) <hi>of the least of all the mercyes, and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto thy Servant,</hi> Gen. 32.10. <hi>I am but duſt and aſhes,</hi>

            <p>It is a degree of unthankfullneſſe to thank God <hi>too Generall,</hi> and not to inſiſt upon the weight, and meaſure, and proportion and goodneſſe of every particular Mercy; ſo it is an irreverent and inconſiderate thing (ſaith a learned, and grave Divine) not to take particular wants into our thoughts, and into our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that ſo we may take a holy knowledge, that we are worth nothing, worthy of nothing, have nothing but from God, and by Prayer.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, It is requiſite that a meritorious work be in ſome ſort <hi>proportionable to the reward;</hi> no work, nor labour, can merit more, then in true eſtimation it is worth; The labourer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth his Hire, but it is ſuch as is correſpondent to his pains: but no other: if he labour but a day, doth he deſerve the hire of two dayes, or a week? Now what Compariſon can there be, betwixt the Glory in Heaven, and our works on Earth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. weigh our ſufferings in the ballance,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.18.</note> with the glory (and yet our ſufferings for Chriſt are of greateſt weight, of all our works) but theſe will be found far too light, in compariſon of the glory: the one is finite, the other infinite, betwixt which there is no proportion.</p>

            <p>Other wayes, yea many other wayes, there are whereby we become great Loſers; but theſe are the moſt ordinary, which I adviſe you to take heed of: ſay not that thou haſt ever loſt by Trading, Gaming, or ill Husbandry; all thy loſſes have come this way. In all our loſſes it is wiſdom (ſaith one) to have an eye to what is left us, as well as to what is loſt.

<pb n="433" facs="tcp:115539:233"/>concerning Prayer, ſhould cauſe you to be in love with it; yet this that is now ſpoken, of the efficacy and power of it, ſhould cauſe you to affect it. <hi>Auſtin</hi> aytly terms Prayer <hi>the key of Heaven,</hi> for that it lets us into Gods treaſury, whence we may take what we will; it opens the Door, and gives us enterance, yea poſſeſſion of the whole houſe. There is a kind of <hi>Omnipotency</hi> in it. Oh! what cannot Prayer do? If the Door of Heaven cannot be kept ſhut againſt it, can priſon Doores? iron gates withſtand it? It cannot be. There is no priſon ſo ſtrong, but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is able to make the Door fly open: Read,<note place="margin">Acts 12.5, 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5, 6, 7. <hi>Peter</hi> is committed to priſon by <hi>Herod,</hi> the Doores are faſt lockt upon him; and leaſt the priſoner ſhould make an eaſcape, he is <hi>bound with two chaines,</hi> and ſtrongly warded with a <hi>double watch:</hi> ſo that in humane judgment there was no poſſibility of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet <hi>Peter</hi> is delivered, and that through the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> The Church ſent up their prayers, and God ſends down his Angel; who awakes him, unbindes him; directs him, inſtructs him, &amp; brings him out of danger, before he leaves him: by which it appears that it was <hi>prayer,</hi> rather then the <hi>Angel</hi> that delivered <hi>Peter</hi> out of priſon; for prayer went up, before the Angel came down. Another like Inſtance we have,<note place="margin">Acts 16.15, 26.</note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25, 26. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> are put into priſon; caſt into the loweſt dungeon; laid faſt in the ſtocks, neck and feet together; made ſure enough, (one would think): they betake themſelves to prayer, they ſend that on their errand into Heaven, and it knocks ſo heard, that it ſhakes <hi>Heaven and Earth;</hi> by and by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Doores were opened, and every mans chaines looſed and fell from him: ſuch is the power of prayer, that no Door can ſtand barrd againſt it.

               </note> is not onely to be found in ſacred ſtory, but it hath bin recorded in all ages of the Church. In the Primitive times, the <hi>Legion of Chriſtians</hi> was called the <hi>thundering Legion;</hi> For that upon their prayers, God ſcattered their enemies with thunder, and refreſhed themſelves with ſhowres in a great drought; which was done when <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> waged war againſt the <hi>Germans:</hi> his Army being brought into a deſperate condition, through great and long thriſt, the Chriſtian Soldiers fell upon their knees, and craved help of God, and were ſuddenly, not onely relieved with great ſhowres of rain, but their enemies were alſo ſtrucken down, with many ſtrokes of thunder; whereupon they were termed, (as aforeſaid) <hi>Cohers Fulminea.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In latter times, we read that <hi>Henriens Anceps</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bucholcer Chronol.</note> upon the prayers of his Soldiers (they crying out with a loud voice Kyrie eleiſon, <hi>Kyrie eleiſon, Lord have mercy upon as, Lord have mercy upon us</hi>) flew and put to flight a mighty Army
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:115539:234"/>of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> by whom he was in danger to be worſted. And we in this Land can bring in our Teſtimony amongſt many other; that great deliverance in <hi>Eighty eight,</hi> from our enemies, which muſt needs be aſcribed to the fruit and powerful effect of prayer, which was then put up to Heaven in that behalf.</p>
            <p>nor doth it want the Teſtimony,<note place="margin">Spec. Belli. Sacri. p. <hi>182.</hi>
               </note> of the enemies of the Church, we read of the <hi>Angronians</hi> a poor people in <hi>France</hi> (that worſhipped God ſincerely, amidſt a whole kingdom of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts) that when as they ſaw the enemy to approach, they would cry altogether, for aid and ſuccour to the Lord: whilſt the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier fought without, the reſt of the people within,<note place="margin">Fox.

            <p>And the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> was ſometimes heard to ſay,<note place="margin">Spec. Bel. Sac.</note> that ſhe more feared the faſtings and prayers of <hi>John Knox,</hi>

Other inſtances might be produced, but I ſhall referr my Reader to <hi>Fox. Mart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>nor hath it power, onely over Heaven, and Earth; but over <hi>Hell too.</hi> Thus our Saviour telleth his Diſciples (being to deal with Spirituall Powers) that ſome <hi>Devils</hi> were ſo ſtrong, that they could not be caſt out, but by <hi>faſting and prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 17.21.</note> 
               <hi>Math.</hi> 17.21. Importing that faſting and prayer, is able to caſt out the ſtouteſt, and ſturdieſt Devil whatſoever. We read of a young man, that had yeilded himſelf body and ſoul to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,<note place="margin">Acts <hi>and</hi> Mon. 788.</note> for money; and had written the bond with his own blood; upon the prayers of <hi>Luther</hi> and ſome others, in his Company, the Devil was forced to come, and throw in the obligation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Mon.</hi> 788.</p>
            <p>In the Life of <hi>Baſil</hi> we have a ſtory, that the Devil appeared to a Penitent Sinner, being at his prayers, and told him, If <hi>you will let me alone, I will let you alone,</hi> meddle not with me, and I will not meddle with you: he found that by the prayers of that good ſoul, God had weakened his power, not onely upon that
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:115539:235"/>man who prayed, but upon others too; therefore he was content to come to a ceſſation of armes with him, that he might turn his forces another way. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> telleth us that the hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall of the firſt <hi>verſe.</hi> of the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. would make all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels in Hell to quake. All conclude with <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that Prayer is <hi>Flagellum Daemonum,</hi> that wherewith we laſh and ſcourge them.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee the prevalent power of Prayer, over <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Earth, and Hell,</hi> It opens for us the <hi>Golden gates of Heaven,</hi> they will not <hi>keep it out:</hi> it flings open the <hi>iron gates on Earth,</hi> yea, the <hi>brazen gates of Hell,</hi> ſo that they cannot <hi>keep us in.</hi> Let us not have this key to ſeek, when we ſhould uſe it, at every to <hi>turn it;</hi> do but turn it the right way, no door can ſtand cloſed againſt it.</p>
            <p>To Conclude.<note place="margin">Eraſ.

            <p>Secondly, albeit God promiſeth not good things to his Church but upon condition, and in the uſe of the meanes; yet it is God that makes effectuall, the condition and meanes themſelves: for in the Covenant of Grace, the <hi>condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us,</hi> is alſo a part of Gods Covenant,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.7, 8, 9, 10.

            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Promiſes that are made of <hi>Grace,</hi> are ſuch as qualifie a man for the ſervice of God, and in exerciſe wherof Gods ſervice ſtands: ſuch as Faith, Hope, Charity, &amp;c.

            <p>In the next place, learn how to entertain, and with what aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to expect them; and that is with <hi>a confident,</hi> and <hi>obedient heart.

As a man in the dark, can better find the way, or door, to which he hath been uſed, then another that never went it, can do by the beſt Inſtructions, that can be given him. So that man who is reading in a book, to which he was uſed, when the twilight ſurprizeth him can longer, and better read in that book, then he who never read in it before. Thus; through Experience, we ſhall better walk in the dark of Tribulation, then others that want it, and go about our Duties of Obedience with more facility, and more readily, then others that are not acquainted with it. Therefore, let Experience have her due praiſe, ſhe is a <hi>good Miſtriſs,</hi> and is able to make <hi>fools wiſe,</hi> and thoſe who are <hi>wiſe, wiſer</hi> then they are: If <hi>commendable,</hi> by Experience, they ſhall become <hi>admirable.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Wherefore, let me exhort you to this point of <hi>Prudence,</hi> to learn by Experience, how to relieve your ſpirits; when they begin to droop and faint, then gather upon God from former experiments of his goodneſs to you, or others: which that you may the better do, take theſe things into conſideration.</p>
            <p>The work of experience, (even of civil things) is of great uſe, (and of no leſs in divine and ſpiritual matters) <hi>it makes us bold with God,</hi> as men are with an experienced friend: ſuch a one is my old friend, my tryed friend, he never denyed me, I'le to him, I dare ſay he will not fail me: So ſaith an experienced Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; God did hear me at ſuch a time, and ſuch a time, I'le to him again. It was the ſaying of a godly man, upon the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a great requeſt that he made to God, <hi>I have tryed God often now I will truſt him,</hi> he never denyed me. We ought, indeed, to truſt God, upon his bare word, although we had never tryed him; but when he ſtoops ſo low, as to help our Faith upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experiments, this ſhould ſtrengthen our confidence, and put
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:115539:245"/>us on to go to God the more chearfully, as to a tryed Friend, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.7.<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is of great uſe, to <hi>quell thoſe diſtruſtful fears, which much diſtract us.</hi> A freſh water Souldier is afraid of every ſhot, and thinks it will coſt him his life, when an experienced ſoldier is fearleſs, and more valorous: ſo it is with an unexperienced Chriſtian, he fears many times, <hi>where no fear is,</hi> he dares not look ſickneſs in the face, poverty in the face, perſecution in the face; but the experienced man is <hi>as bold as a Lion;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 53.5. Prov. 28. Rom. 8.38, 39.</note> he fears none of all theſe things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. Experience makes a man a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring man: where read you of two ſuch Champions as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul?</hi> and where of two that made more uſe of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments then they?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It <hi>quiets the heart in God's abſence;</hi> and in time of deſertion, it waiteth, with patience, for his approach again: ſhould one, born in a Dungeon (that never in his life-time ſaw the Sun) be brought forth, and ſhewed it; would he not, when he ſaw it ſet, think it to be quite loſt? But Experience teacheth us, that the next morning it will appear again, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us patiently to wait for the riſing of it: So is it with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Chriſtian, he knows that Goo's concealing of himſelf is but a wiſe Diſcipline for a time; and that he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hide himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. &amp; 43.5. &amp; 77.7, 8, 9.<note place="margin">Pſal. 42. &amp; 43 5. &amp; 77.7, 8, 9.</note> So ſaid that <hi>Martyr</hi> to his Friend <hi>Auſtin, He is come</hi> Auſtin, <hi>he is come:</hi> albeit, for a time, he had no ſenſe of comfort. When I want fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſenſe of Goo's favour, yet by former workings in my ſoul, which I have had experience of, I may be ſure that I <hi>am God's Child.</hi> As a woman that hath felt the Babe in the Womb quick and ſtirring, albeit it lye ſtill for a while, yet ſhe knows that ſhe is with child, by that which ſhe hath formerly felt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it <hi>ſweetens Gods Promiſes</hi> and mercies to us: As he that hath taſted honey, knows the ſweetneſs of it, better then any man can do by the reading of it: So he that taſtes <hi>how good God is</hi> in an experimental way, finds more ſweetneſs therein, then in all that he hears, or reades thereof. The beſt Miniſter on Earth cannot teach ſo much of God's love and favour, as <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> doth. There is far more ſweetneſs to be found in the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Promiſes,</hi> then can be conceived, in holding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:115539:246"/>themſelves. As one that hath poſſeſſion of an inheritance, finds more ſweetneſs therein, then he could find whilſt it was his only in reverſion, and expectation. And he that ſees the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sun, takes farr more delight in it, then a blind man from his birth that heares the Theory of the Sun read unto him. The meditation of Divines upon the joyes of Heaven, are able to raviſh the ſoul of the reader with much delight, yet they are nothing to that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> found in his rapture into the third Heaven,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.2.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly; It is experience, and obſervation <hi>that doth make a man to be a wiſe Chriſtian;</hi> what makes old men to be wiſer then the yonger ſort,<note place="margin">Job. 12.12.</note> as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, but experience (which youth wants)? breathed Deer, are not ſo quickly caught; nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Chriſtians ſo ſoon entangled with the worl'ds deceits, and Sathans ſnares. It is only this experimentall knowledge that makes a man expert in the trade and warfare of a Chriſtian. Take a man that hath only read much of Husbandry, Phyſick, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, and Martiall affaires, and gotten into his head the notion of all theſe; yet one that hath not read half ſo much, but hath been of long practiſe, and good experience in theſe, will go as farr beyond the other; as he doth that hath read much, &amp; wants experience, beyond one that is a meere novice in them.</p>

            <p>Call to mind, and keep in mind the many favours God hath beſtowed on thee, from thy Childhood, in providing meat for thy mouth, cloath for thy back, <hi>&amp;c. Have you forgotten</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>how I fed you with a little bread and a few fiſhes:</hi>

            <p>Call to mind, and keep a record of the paſſages of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards others; whether of Juſtice, or of mercy.

            <p>Secondly; then <hi>plead them unto God;</hi> bring them out of thy treaſury, and make uſe of them, as occaſion requires.

This is no good argument with man; Sir, you have helped me often, therefore help me ſtill; but with God it is a <hi>prevayling argument:</hi> we want not arguments of this kind, there is none of us but can ſay to God now this houre; Lord thou haſt preſerved me this day hitherto, and brought me hither, now Lord enable me to heare: Lord thou doſt that too, therefore enable me to underſtand, and thou doſt that for me too, now enable me to beleeve: and ſeeing thou haſt given me grace to beleeve, give me ſtrength that I may practiſe: and if all that be granted, deſire grace to perſevere unto the end.

            <p>See then that you Regiſter God's favours, and paſs not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly by God's dealings with you, or others; for in ſo doing, you fling that ſtaff out of your hands which ſhould ſtay you, and ſupport you.

Let the cauſe we undertake be good, and our Calling to the undertaking warrantable, and ſo we may ſafely reaſon from Experience, and ſtrengthen our Faith thereby. And thus we have ſpoke to the Antecedent of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; God is liberal to all that call upon him, proved from Experience: Now we come to the Conſequent, then much more will he give you Audience, who are his Friends and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c.

            <p>Thus generals are particularly to be applyed. The Lord, in aſſenting to <hi>Solomon's</hi> Prayer, made a general promiſe to all the people, that what Prayer or Supplication ſoever ſhould be made

            <p>And as generals are particulars, ſo particularly are generally, applyable where the ground is general. The Lord encouraged <hi>Joſua</hi> to go on where <hi>Moſes</hi> left, upon this ground; <hi>As I was with</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſo I will be with thee, I will never fail thee, nor forſake thee,</hi> Joſ. 1.5.

            <p>And thus <hi>David</hi> encourageth himſelf to call on God from God's gracious dealings with others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.4. and propounds his own example for a Preſident to others, in point of Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6.

            <p>Secondly; in the Application of thoſe Generall promiſes to thy ſelf, which God hath made to others; ſee thou bring like <hi>Qualifications,</hi> and then ſpare not to inferr according to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude thereof, God will receive all Penitents into favour, and forgive their ſins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. but ſee that thou be a true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, if thou would'd comfortably apply that promiſe to thy ſelf. Obſerve theſe Cautions, and then thou may'ſt comfortably apply Generalls to thy own <hi>particular,</hi> for thy encouragement, and ſtrengthening.</p>
